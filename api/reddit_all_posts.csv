1jd2x47,"Confusion with support, average cost, and equity value at Robinhood","Sorry for the length of this post, I thought this was an easy one but maybe not. I tried posting it in the Robinhood sub, but the moderators rejected it. Why, I couldn't say, though I do think it's more directly relevant there, though shouldn't be too much of a stretch for this sub. 

This is specific to crypto - BCH - but that doesn't matter as the metrics are the same for stocks and crypto.

I sold off most of my BCH holdings today, so that there was only 1 coin left. That made it, IMO, really straightforward to see that there was an error in the equity calculation.

I have 1 coin. Market value of 1 coin was \~$335. Therefore my equity position was \~$335. But the platform says it's \~$282.

So, I contacted support. Started with the crypto team. They transferred me away to the stock and equities team. They reviewed it and sent it back to the crypto team.

The last agent ended up telling me that equity amount was the real average cost. We went back-and-forth a bit debating that, then it ended with the support agent ending the chat so quickly I couldn't even respond to his last message. I type \~90 WPM with 0 - 1 errors, so I know it wasn't just a fast type job, he definitely typed out the message first, then copy/pasted it in and ended the chat. Which at the end of what turned into well over an hour, was frustrating, but not the issue. It IS why I'm here checking to make sure I'm not crazy or missing anything though.

**Am I missing something? This seems so straightforward, it's a math/calculating error, right? Or a label error, because I can sell the 1 coin right now, and receive more than the $280 equity.**

I sent each one of them a screenshot showing what I was saying. Here's the three screenshots, and the conversation starting with when the third agent picked up after reviewing the chat history.

[First screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/lulvcjo3x4pe1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d1b74bd67d8dc939eb808cedb518be3724f477c)

So, the third agent ""figures"" it out. Here's the conversation, my replies are in bold, their replies are italic. :

>*I am back and I appreciate you for waiting. As I take a look into your screenshot, you are seeing your equity as $283.13. To let you know, this is the amount you paid for the BCh you bought throughout the time your BCH is in your account. It will not show you the current value of crypto you hold base on the market value of the BCH since it is only the reference point of how much you paid for the crypto itself.*

>**That's not correct.**

>*That is why there is an average cost. Robinhood defines average cost as the cost per share of your current open position. It is used to calculate the unrealized profit and loss of your current position*

>**What I paid throughout the the time of my bch is the average cost**

>**The equity amount is how much my current holdings are worth**

>**and this one is worth \~333ish**

>**not \~280ish**

>*So if you want to look for the value of your crypto based in the current market, you will check the average cost.*

>**No.**

>*Check our* [*Help Center*](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/average-cost/#AverageCostandCostBasisarenotthesamething) *for more information about this.*

>**Average cost isn't the value. Because that value goes up or down depending on the price of the crypto.**

>**My average cost only goes up or down if I make a purchase**  
**I'm sorry, but what you're saying is completely wrong..**

>**The equity amount is the value of my holdings. Current holdings.**  
**I couldn't be more sure of anything in life.**

>**It's also only happening with BCH so far as I can tell**  
**Average cost wouldn't be the value of my holdings lol. Its the average COST, not value, not equity..**

>*I understand, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. If that is what you believe in, I would not argue with that at all. I am only relaying the information I can see in your account. As I check here, the total equity in your screenshot matches your total cost for the BCH. Please check our Help Center to know more about the average cost.*

>**ok, maybe it matches the average cost, but it shouldn't.**  
**i did check it. Did you?**

>*I did.*

>**I sent the Robinhood definition from help center:** If you’re using an earlier app version for stocks, ETFs, and options trading, Robinhood defines Average Cost as the weighted average amount paid for shares (buys). For crypto, the average cost is the total notional value of the crypto assets you’ve purchased on Robinhood, divided by the total quantity of crypto assets you’ve acquired on the platform. For crypto, the average cost is calculated by dividing the total amount spent on purchasing that specific crypto on Robinhood (including all purchases since opening your account) by the total quantity of that crypto acquired on the platform.

>**I'm not asking about average cost. I'm asking about the equity, which is the market value. And I believe it used to be labeled market value as well.**

>**I have no question about average cost. So I'm not sure how that is supposed to answer this inquiry..**

>**You sentYeah, look at any of my other crypt holdings. That equity number = the market price x my holdings. For all of them but BCH it appears**

>*You are looking for the value of your BCH based on the value of the market correct? That is the average cost. The equity you are seeing as I have mentioned seems to be the total cost of how much you bought the said crypto. But you know what, I will just reach out to our team for more information. Maybe they can enlighten us about this. Stay on the line and I will reach out to our internal team.*

>**No it's not. That's... Well I'm not even sure how you could think that or say that. It's 100% not.**

>**Thank you for reaching out to someone else**

1jd1mhf,When is Bitcoin going to be a reserve asset like Gold?,"Bitcoin and gold are similar in that they have value because people agree they do. However, gold also surves a structural purpose in that people can park wealth in gold when other asset types are in a downturn, say, like in the 2008 crash. So gold serves as a safe haven with the promise of being able to change it back to other assets in the future. 

Bitcoins could serve the same function, but instead Bitcoins seem to track stock prices rather than be a safe haven in a market crash.

Is Bitcoins always going to be a rally asset, or will it change to behave more like gold in the future?

**EDIT**: It seems most are in agreement that Bitcoins are a joke! Anyway, this was actually meant as a serious question!

The reasoning is that if a structural benefit of Bitcoins can be determined, you can begin to speculate on what its proper total market cap should be. Right now gold is about 3% of the total, while Bitcoin is about 0.4%. But if Bitcoin becomes an essential structural asset, you might predict that its relative market cap should increase before it stabilizes.

However, if Bitcoins remain a rally yolo asset, it is hard to see its structural value. That's why I am interested in whether it might gravitate towards being a safe haven or diversifying asset instead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jd1mhf/when_is_bitcoin_going_to_be_a_reserve_asset_like/,1742175932.0
1jd1dvq,Little growth vs long term growth. Need advice,Crazy title but I’m 17 turning 18 this month and need advice. Once I turn 18 I plan to open up a retirement account (Roth IRA with mutual funds) and a brokerage account for stocks with dividends and such. Along with this I also plan on getting a credit card with a substantial limit as the one I currently have has a 250 dollar limit. I won’t be going crazy with it.

I know gold and silver is a good hedge against inflation but doesn’t grow much. Keep in mind my stack is 98 percent silver. Is it better to sell the stack I have and put it in these 2 accounts that I’m opening or keep the stack and invest any money that I put aside from future checks?

1jczdq2,£2.4m ($3.12m) in cash to invest for growth,"£2.4m ($3.12m) in cash to invest

50 year old United Kingdom based wants to invest cash savings (with emphasis on low costs)

- Total Net worth £3.6m ($4.7m) consisting of: 

- £1.2m ($1.5m) in 3 London properties (2 of which produce rental income) 
- £2.4m ($3.12m) in cash

Annual Income from work and rent £100,000 ($130,000) is enough to live on so want to invest the cash for the long term to grow and compound. 

Buffett suggests putting 90% in stocks in a low cost S&P500 tracker ETF / fund and forget about it. The market and compound growth will do the rest. Up to now, he’s been 100% right. 

Tempted to do as he suggests as not interested in trying to outperform market. In it for the very long term (20-30 years). Volatility along the way is of little concern. 

The second option is to invest it all or half with Berkshire Hathaway. Why not? 

Third option is to invest it in a standard portfolio of global stocks, commodities and bonds (favoured by most financial advisors) but which will likely underperform the market in the long run, though with lower volatility. 

Not sure what to do, especially given extreme overvalued US and other stock markets (even after recent 10% correction) according to Buffett Indicator and others.

1jcx2s7,Placing bonds in ROTH IRA,"My investing strategy has been to piece together a portfolio across my accounts that approximates the investments and allocation of a Vanguard target date fund.  Vanguard allocates 5% of the portfolio to international bonds.

My 401k has a good total US bond fund, but nothing for international bonds.  So to date I've been placing the international bonds into my ROTH to avoid taxes on the bonds.  At this point my international bond position is getting large enough that I'm questioning whether this is a good idea - putting it into a tax deferred account is tax efficient, but offset by reducing growth in a tax free account compared to holding stocks.

I've been thinking maybe I should just keep it simple and buy more US bonds in the 401k and switch to a stock fund in the ROTH.  I noticed Fidelity for example only holds 1.6% international bonds in the same target date, so I'm not sure there's much need to worry about this.

So I'm trying to decide between three options:
1) Keep 5% of the portfolio in international bonds in my ROTH
2) Keep 5% in international bonds but switch it to taxable
3) Redirect the 5% international bonds to US bonds in my 401k, changing that from bonds to stocks in the ROTH

I will not find a comparable job in my field at my age, jobs are rare and there is too much ageism. 

My advisor said the worst case scenario for my $ is to have to live off what I can take without penalties if the market drops significantly (e.g., recession) - I’d have to take about 10% per year, selling low, and my plan would fail. 

Also, I am at 70% stock, so fairly exposed - have already lost 8% in the past month. 

He suggests protecting the non tax-deferred part (about half, $700k or so) of my portfolio in a short-term annuity that pays 4.5% to try to mitigate against losing too much more if there’s a recession, keeping the rest in 70% stocks or higher.

It'll be an unprecedented trend that no one really knows how it will play out exactly, but there are a few ideas: 

* First world countries will lean heavily on immigration to sustain the workforce (we're seeing this now), until the pipeline dries up

* Programs like Social Security and Medicare will cease to exist in their current forms since there will be more people drawing from it than paying in

* The housing market will flip upside down, there will be more houses than people so entire markets will crash and probably never recover, the hardest hit being the suburbs. Cities should still be okay.

* Global GDP will tank, so stock markets may start declining or going sideways due to smaller workforce/less innovation. Deflation is a definite possibility

* AI/Robotics will probably be a huge player in some form, maybe quantum computing finally?

1jconf8,Felons are not allowed to own stocks???,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some help here. I was recently released from prison after serving 6 years for distribution of cannabis. 

Before I went in I had a brokerage account with Wells Fargo. When I came home about a month ago I had a lot of notifications that my account needed to either be liquidated and closed or transferred to another institution immediately. 

I tried fidelity but they don’t accept felons. 
Another felon I know tried robinhood but they don’t accept felons. A friend recommended Chase because they have a policy where they hire people with adverse backgrounds, so I called Chase and spoke with two different advisors and they confirmed that, yes that is JP Morgan Chase’s policy and they confirmed that there would be no issue with me opening a brokerage account. 

So I opened an account and I even had a senior advisor in the escalations department make a three way phone call with me to the Wells Fargo advisor to confirm to Wells Fargo that the ACAT was legitimate and so Wells Fargo could lift the restrictions off my account to complete the transfer. After the phone call, it took about 2-3 days for the ACAT to go through and I had a fully functioning brokerage account. 

I began adding more legitimate funds through a bank transfer and bagan buying stocks and ETFs. I woke up this morning with an email that said I had an important account notification. I opened my account to check the notification and it said that “after further review” JP Morgan Chase has decided to discontinue services with me and have given me until May 12th to liquidate my account or transfer my positions to another institution. 

I believe that FINRA has rules about felons having brokerage accounts and it seems that every banking institution is associated with FINRA. Does anyone have ideas of what I can do? 

I considered opening a trust and making my sister the trustee and listing myself as the beneficiary. There has to be someway to be invested in the market. If not, I’ll be relegated to 2.5% CDs and my finances are screwed the rest of my life. Any advice helps, thanks!


EDIT: yes I do have a secondary money laundering charge as well for paying my home mortgage with suspected proceeds from my drug crime.

If we set aside Samsung for South Korea and TSMC for Taiwan, although Taiwan’s stock market seems more open than South Korea’s, its industries are quite lopsided. Beyond semiconductors, the profit margins of Taiwanese companies are almost universally low. South Korea, on the other hand, seems more closed-off, but its industries are relatively more diversified, and their profit margins almost always outperform those of Taiwanese companies.

1jcoidy,A Message For Calm And Sanity,"We all know the market and economy is wracked with uncertainty, and that has led to a lot of doomer posts. I'm writing this here not to argue that there are not problems, but to state why a madman in the White House may not equal the apocalypse.

THIS IS NOT THE FIRST CATASTROPHE THE MARKET HAS ENCOUNTERED

If you read no further, this is the main point. Recessions, stagflation, wars, pandemics, etc. So many times everyone has said ""this is the end"", but it wasn't. You should fundamentally distrust anyone saying that ""this is the end"" because it never is.

TRUMP WONT DESTROY THE USA... PROBABLY

Trump is going to do damage. There's no way around it. I'm scared about what is going to happen, just like everyone. However, the damage most likely won't end the whole country. Keep in mind we are starting from a place of being the biggest, strongest, and best economy and stock market in the world. Period.

Trump will damage things. He may even cause permanent harm. But there's a different between significant permanent harm and everything going to zero.

In short, everyone should have international investments (and should've had that even before this), but abandoning the US market entirely is foolish.

TRUMP CAN EASILY CHANGE COURSE

We're dealing with a mercurial narcissist. I can easily see Canada/Mexico/EU/etc giving him some tiny thing, something that costs them very little. Then Trump turns around and declares he has made the biggest, most beautiful deal in the history of the USA and ends the trade war ""victorious"".

If that happens, markets will rally like crazy. Abandoning the US market means you miss it.

CONCLUSION

Just have a balanced, diversified portfolio with appropriate international exposure and you'll be fine no matter what happens.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jcoidy/a_message_for_calm_and_sanity/,1742140400.0
1jcohtz,What is the best way to approach rebalancing during a downturn?,"Right now the majority of my retirement accounts (401k, IRAs) are in an 500 Index fund, and I put the same amount into my IRA/401k each month at regular intervals with the same proportion into the 500 fund and other smaller investments. **How would I approach rebalancing during a downturn like this so less of my portfolio is weighted towards the 500 fund moving forward?**

Selling a portion of my current 500 fund holdings (taxes aside since these accounts are tax-advantaged) to purchase other funds/stocks doesn't seem to make sense since that would lock in losses, but at the same time, investing less proportionally with future contributions also doesn't seem to make sense since AFAIK the aim of DCA is to buy the same amount regularly during high periods and low periods to take advantage of pricing (lower quantity when the price is high, higher quantity when the price is low), and my understanding is if you reduce what you're contributing (proportionally) into a fund/stock during a downturn, you're not getting the advantage of buying more at a lower price.

**Is there a good way to approach a rebalance during a downturn, or is it just a choice between two not great options?** I'm also not in any rush (in my mid 20s), so **would it make more sense to stay the current course and approach a rebalance when pricing hopefully recovers / is on an upswing?**

1jcnfo5,Reputable Europe-based broker,"So, we've reached the point in the political climate where I'm actually starting to get concerned about the safety of having my money in the US, which is crazy. Specifically, I'm concerned about the US government defaulting on bonds, about the USD inflating without interest rates being appropriately raised to match, and about the administration taking steps down the road to block capital flight out of the US.

I don't want to be stuck in a position where the US economy melts down and my nest egg is trapped here and gets wiped out, so I would like to move my money abroad to a less risky environment.

Right now, my money is mostly invested through Schwab, plus a bit in a Barclays HYSA denominated in dollars. I'm looking for a Europe-based brokerage through which I can invest as I'm used to with Schwab, right now probably mostly in European government bonds but, generally, in international stock ETFs as well.

I'm not even sure which platforms, exactly, would be out of reach of the US government. [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1bevdl4/what_are_some_trustable_brokers_in_europe_should/) about European brokers recommends IBKR, but that's actually based in Connecticut, so I assume it's no safer than Schwab or whatever? Trading 212 seems a bit like a Robinhood-type app for Europe, but it uses IBKR on its backend. That is maybe still safer than using IBKR directly, since the assets it owns through IBKR are presumably not traceable to individual accounts? I'd still probably rather be in something completely Europe-based as possible, since I don't want to take a risk on US securities or bonds for the foreseeable future.

I don't know whether I'm even thinking through the risks here correctly. Anyone have any advice?

I'm a dual US-Ireland citizen, in case that affects my eligibility for certain brokerages. Or perhaps not - maybe they tend to actually have European residency requirements. I'm continuing to live in the US for now, but fully prepared to move across the pond if shit gets dire.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jcnfo5/reputable_europebased_broker/,1742137480.0

I was unemployed the rest of the year, and just before it ended spoke to a T Rowe Price rep about my options of retirement investing myself before 2025 began, he mentioned the Traditional IRA that would deduct the invested amount from my taxable income that year, or Roth where taxes would be taken out up front, then I could draw from untaxed in retirement.

  
I opted for Traditional IRA and put in the max of $7,000 in December 2024. Now that I'm filling out my taxes (single), that apparently was a mistake, because my IRA deduction is limited to only $200 because of the fact that I had access to a retirement plan at work the same year (even though I didn't contribute to the personal IRA until after I was laid off), and my MAGI range fell between their threshold of $77,000-$87,000 for the year. I would have been much better off contributing to the Roth IRA and just having taxes taken out now, since most of my traditional IRA contribution ended up taxed anyway and will get taxed again when I withdraw in retirement.

1jc0xk4,The situation of the market,"
Many stocks in the market are significantly overvalued—Tesla, Apple, Costco, Palantir, and much of the FMCG and pharmaceutical sectors, considering their sluggish growth. Even Nvidia could see its valuation tumble if China or AMD develop viable alternatives.

Market crashes don’t worry me; they’re necessary and often present great buying opportunities. What truly concerns me is the long-term effect of excess liquidity. Inflation is brewing beneath the surface, and we’ll see its full impact in the years ahead. Over time, the velocity of money has declined while the money supply has surged, artificially propping up asset prices. My real fear isn’t a crash—it’s that inflation-adjusted returns will shrink to irrelevance.

Bonds are effectively useless. Stocks are outrageously priced, making it difficult to generate meaningful returns. This isn’t a market for investors—it’s a market for those looking to cash out. Genuine opportunities are scarce.

If inflation accelerates, cash will erode, bonds will remain dead weight, and overpriced stocks will have no room for growth. In the end, nobody wins. After years of zero interest rates and relentless quantitative easing, my biggest concern is that when the real downturn hits, the Fed will have little ammunition left to respond.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jc0xk4/the_situation_of_the_market/,1742061352.0

I often remind myself of Buffet's quote, ""Don't lose."" That has guided me for a very long time in my business, which was based on investing in natural resources. And also in equities. I do take some risks, significant ones, yes, but I try my best to pick winners such that, at least, I do not lose! (Thankfully, I have been right most of the time.) I also take some big reward, risky shots now and then when I believe in something.

What is your take on what to do from this point forward? TIA!

P.S.  I have a nice income coming in that provides a good living. The nest egg growth is desired for legacy. Some family but mostly charity.

EDIT:  For those who say don't worry, it's the same old song, for decades people think the party's over. As for me, I \*do\* think that chaos and a new world order is in store. I \*do\* think that an energy crisis is shaping up. I \*do\* think that the planet is revolting, that we are exhausting its resources and that economies will/must suffer. I \*do\* think geopolitical risks are worst than ever. I \*do\* think that trump's rise and acceptance is indicative of a very sick nation. And that his handlers are going to cause a shakeup like this country (and world) have never seen. So, that's why I think investing as if everything stays the same is flawed. If someone disagrees, that's fine but that is my take. I can't believe the news cycle I witness every day. It is truly unbelievable.

1jc0bhz,The Special Case for $RDDT,"Reddit is one of the premier social media apps out there with a cheap valuation (never judge a growth stock by P/E) for its growth trajectory.

Let's start with the fundamentals:

1. 2024 YE it had a 90.5% gross profit percentage, revenue grew by 62% (NVIDIA like growth??) and it became FCF positive. Next quarter revenue will be growing at 50% to ultimately end at 40% YoY based on guidance. I've been following $RDDT for quite some time and there is always a beat on revenue AND guidance versus what they expected so you can say there is a little bit of conservatism in this numbers.
2. From a balance sheet perspective it only has $26.7mm of debt. This company generated $215mm in FCF this year and is forecast to double to $520mm by next year. Capex spend is only 2% of its revenue. This companies management loves to run things efficiently and as cheaply as possible. On going concern is not an issue.
3. The company is already EPS positive and will turn EPS positive on a YoY basis by 2025 YE. If you look at it from a PEG perspective, it is trading at 0.74 for 2026. Anything below 1 is cheap. The only reason you see negative EPS is because the company has been expensing stock based compensation (US GAAP) requirement each quarter. This has ended in 2024, that is why you see major acceleration in EPS growth QoQ moving forward.
4. Share dilution is very minimal. A lot of growth companies like to pay employees in stock to attract talent, but that is not what reddit does. Diluated shares outstanding actually fell 1% QoQ. This is great for any share holder.
5. Reddit data is a gold mine. Google pays Reddit $66mm a year for data licensing. This has 85% operating margin - so you need to remember Reddits profitability isn't going away anytime soon because you are starting from a high point.
6. Insider trading has popped up this weekend after the crazy drop. That is a significant buy signal.
7. From a multiple standpoint, price to sales, revenue etc it has gotten cheaper despite the stock increasing in value. Reddit user growth has exploded over time, with 50% international base and is becoming a hit globally. Reddit's top 15 advertisers spent 50% more YoY and international ad revenue grew by 77%.

\- THIS IS IMPORTANT. If US were to go slow down, the international piece provides a buffer on revenue for the company.

8) Advertising approach is incredibly unique. Reddit offers companies the ability to have AMAs to offer product information. I've personally seen this in my time using this reddit. Each subreddit is highly specialized which makes advertising that much easier. People pay Meta and Google top dollar because they are able to use statistical AI inference to generate ad campaigns well. Reddit doesn't need that. If you sell bikes, there's a laundry list of bike subreddits you can target. This is the future as Ad targeting improves on Reddit.

Downside / Bear bases:

1. Highly dependent on Google search. Google search was the reason that Reddit fell after earnings because of the average daily user count fell. Management has said this happens often in its existence and they worked quickly to get back on top of user searches. Management was largely dismissive of this because of their experience and noted higher levels of people asking questions and typing reddit at the end into google.
2. AI Capex slows down. This will erode profitability on the company, but given how ""clean"" reddit data is, this is the least of my concerns.
3. Execution and ad platform growth. Growing is expensive, and if Reddit adopts a spend what you can to get it done it will have investors fearful. Based on their CFO's commentary this is not very likely because how they approach things and history shows.
4. User growth slows down. This is highly possible, but I do believe the international side of things will be a buffer on user growth.

Having said all of this, my PT is $250 for the company. This is an absolute long term hold.

Any dips should be bought and even though Reddit looks expensive at face value, it really isn't. It trades at 50x forward earnings with 50% YoY growth and a net profitability that will approach 30+%. People are paying almost triple for Palantir and other software stocks out there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jc0bhz/the_special_case_for_rddt/,1742059727.0

5% Crypto 
10% Berkshire Hathaway

1jbv0bk,JPMorgan’s Asset Management Division Launches US Research Enhanced Large Cap ETF: Retail’s Positive,"According to J.P. Morgan Asset Management, the ETF offers a distinctive approach to U.S. equity exposure by utilizing proprietary research and concentrating on well-established, large-cap U.S. companies.

JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) said on Friday that its asset management division has launched the JPMorgan U.S. Research Enhanced Large Cap ETF (JUSA) on the New York Stock Exchange.

According to J.P. Morgan Asset Management, JUSA offers a distinctive approach to U.S. equity exposure by utilizing proprietary research and concentrating on well-established, large-cap U.S. companies.

The company said the fund is managed by portfolio managers Ralph Zingone and Tim Snyder, who bring extensive expertise in managing research-enhanced strategies.

It explained that JUSA is designed with a slightly lower active risk budget and a more significant number of holdings, providing broader diversification. “This makes it an attractive option for investors looking for consistent returns in their U.S. equity exposure,” the firm said.

The company has been implementing the underlying strategy since 1988, it added.

On Thursday, Morgan Stanley lowered its price target on JPMorgan to $275 from $278 while keeping an ‘Equal Weight’ rating on the shares.

According to TheFly, Morgan Stanley said the robust capital markets rebound it expected in 2025 is not playing out as anticipated. The firm is lowering its estimates for investment banking revenues due to recent market conditions, as volatility likely pushes out deal launches.

However, the brokerage noted that large-cap bank and mid-cap advisor stocks ""appear oversold against our new base case.”

Earlier this week, Bank of America, too, lowered its price target on JPMorgan to $285 from $300 while keeping a ‘Buy’ rating on the shares.

According to TheFly, the brokerage lowered price targets among its banks coverage by 6% on average, led by worsening growth and a rising cost of capital.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jbv0bk/jpmorgans_asset_management_division_launches_us/,1742044985.0

1jbsotp,"$HITI : NASDAQ , in-depth and detailed research","The importance of buying young, great companies is something everyone knows, but few people actually do it or really care. The truth is that in the market you earn more by investing in young, transformative and disruptive companies, which offer unique services; they also must be capable of being leaders in what they offer and they must have proven this.

Large companies take years to build, or decades, and in the meantime the stock is subject to significant fluctuations for various reasons, rates at historic highs that weigh on valuations, wars, uncertainty, etc..

The key is to let the business grow, year after year, not by focusing on the stock, but on the continuous progress of the company's business, remaining invested for years or even decades.

To quote Buffet: ""The market is a system of redistribution of wealth, it takes away from those who don't have patience to give to those who have it""

**Margins will increase in the coming years and I will cite some reasons that lead me to be sure of this:**

* Constant growth in Elite membership, now on an international basis (70% gross margin at current membership price of CAD $35/annual in Canada, 15US $ international -> double from next year ), I estimate they will exceed 100K by end of this march
* Completion of Fastlender installations and license sale (high margin Saas model) expected soon
* The continued increase in market share in Canada and the reduction of competitors will allow HITI to increase prices and therefore gross margins
* Increase in white label products / elite inventory
* Recovery in demand for CBD products starting in Q1/Q2
* More favorable regulatory conditions in Canada
* Increasing scale will allow you to exploit operational leverage and increase overall efficiency
* Purecan Gmbh acquisition will prove accretive to Hiti's gross margins

**By 2030** **Hiti will have :**

* Over 1 bln annual revenue (not include Germany, only canada and cbd)
* Gross margins 30/40%
* 100 mln in fcf+ on an annual basis at a conservative level
* over 20 million subscribers with 1 mln in Elite members ( 5% of total )
* Expansion into new markets and verticals complementary to current products
* Innovations and strategies underway that we don't know about

**High Tide inc ( $HITI ) is capturing market share every quarter, both from competitors and illicit market.**

**In three years, the company's market share grew from 4% to 11%, and it is well-positioned to reach 20% over the next 2/3 years just in Canada** (probably also in Germany in the long term, on the medical side).

High Tide inc has established itself as the leading cannabis and consumer accessories retailer in North America, from a simple store with 2 employees to the empire it is today. And we are only at the beginning of a long growth

$HITI It's not just fending off competition, it's absorbing it, solidifying market dominance, and reshaping its narrative from a high-growth, money-burning gamble into a disciplined, self-sustaining, and enduring enterprise.

High Tide inc [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is not just a retailer. Called [$Cost](https://x.com/search?q=%24Cost&src=cashtag_click) of cannabis, [$hiti](https://x.com/search?q=%24hiti&src=cashtag_click) is a real estate empire disguised as a retailer. Here's how they built the most brilliant business model ever created and why it will dominate its industry in the coming years

**1) THE TRUTH ABOUT High Tide** : They're not a simple retail. They're at:

* Supply Chain Monster

* Brand Powerhouse
* Cost model implementation successfully replicated

**2) Their actual business**:

1. Buy prime locations
2. Collect and sell data
3. Control quality
4. Prevent competition
5. create a large, ever-growing loyalty base, [$cost](https://x.com/search?q=%24cost&src=cashtag_click) style
6. dominate the sector in which they operate, with a focus on international expansion in the coming years

**3) LOCATION STRATEGY EXPOSED:** [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) win by positioning their stores in locations that count. They buy corners with: High traffic, Easy access, Good visibility, Growing areas, Future potential

**4) DATA MONSTER REVELATION**: [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) track everything: -consumer preferences -Competition data -Traffic patterns -Weather impact -Local preferences -Pricing elasticity

The Result? Insights to make perfect decisions for the long term

**5) THE MOAT FRAMEWORK:** [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) has a multi-layered MOAT. It's unbeatable advantages:

Prime real estate, Scale economics, Brand recognition, Supply chain power, Data insights, Operating systems. But the real moat and pillar imo is the CEO.

**6) FUTURE-PROOFING STRATEGY:** Thing is - [$Hiti](https://x.com/search?q=%24Hiti&src=cashtag_click) does not stop there. They are constantly investing in the future. Current investments include, but not limited to: Mobile ordering, Delivery integration, Fastlendr technology, Data analytics, Sustainability, Digital experience and more

**7) COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:**

* Location monopoly
* Price power
* Scale benefits
* Brand value
* Operating system
* Data insights
* Supplier control, And guess what - it's impossible to replicate all 7.

**8) THE SECRET SAUCE:** Real estate appreciation + Franchise cash flow + Supply chain control + Brand power + Operating system + Data advantage + Location dominance = Unstoppable business

**9) Remember**: Assets > Operations Systems > Products Location > Everything Brand = Wealth Data = Power Scale = Control And most importantly: Consistency wins

**The most transformative long-term winners don’t merely participate in markets -- they redefine them. They birth entirely new industries, unlock vast, untapped revenue streams, or revolutionize monetization models to a degree that reshapes financial landscapes.**

I have a pension with my current company, as well as some previous smaller ones which I plan to consolidate at some point.

But now I’m ready to open a Stocks and Shares ISA and save money on the side to grow. Currently I only have cash savings, but I can see how my pension has tripled the last 10 years, as my money is sitting in a “fund”.

Ive been researching hard the last 12 months, I never was taught financial literacy by my parents, so I’m really grateful for this sub! 

But I don’t know why, I still feel so nervous to open up a Stocks and Shares ISA on fidelity/vanguard.  I find it nerve wracking, but it just must be a financial literacy confidence thing.

Anyway, I’ve narrowed this down to 3 funds. And I just wanted to get advice on which you guys think, is the best to invest in.

I’m looking for a global fund, as I don’t just want to invest in S&P, as I don’t think Trump will be good for the American economy in the long term.  

All of these funds seemed to have tripled their performance over the last 3 years and did ok during covid.

But I just wasn’t sure which of the 3 to go for. Just wanted to get your thoughts.

I’m looking to slowly build up a nice pot of savings over the next 20-30 years.

1. Vanguard Total World Stock Index (VTWAX)
2. Fidelity Index World Fund (MSCI World Tracker)
3. HSBC FTSE All World Index

I tbh I I’m just confused which one to go for.

The only discussion I saw was this one here, where everyone was against the OP and couldn\*t really dissolve his concerns other then ""The future is great because of ....."" (which we all already know and which the market knows) : [https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditIPO/comments/1j81q8o/time\_to\_shreddit\_or\_is\_there\_still\_a\_chance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditIPO/comments/1j81q8o/time_to_shreddit_or_is_there_still_a_chance/)

In this post he describes it well that only because a product and company and the future are great doesn\*t always automaticly mean, that the stock has to go up. I always like to look at overall trends and history. And If I look at all these other social media companies which rely mostly on just ads and have seen high user growth in the past and had a hype are going now side ways. If you just did buy and hold you did make money but these haven\*t been stocks where it just goes up in a straigth line. (can be very volatile, but with constant trend that its a winner stock) They mostly go sideways and have been staying on the same level for years now.

What I mean with winner stock, for example IBKR. They have had a lot of volatility and a lot of downfalls. (If you look back and zoom out it just doesn\*t look like this stock has fallen a lot during some periods)

For me it makes sense to invest more into Reddit if it will become a winner stock like this for example which has huge falls but the sucess is in a long term uptrend.

And yea, I know Reddit is now also making 15% of its revenue with AI deals with Google and OpenAI. This is of course nice and great, but ads will still be the main revenue stream for the next 5 years. The Ai deals are overhyped. Most Ais just keep scraping it and there is almost nothing reddit can do to limit scraping. it will still be cheaper to just scrape it then to make a deal with Reddit unless you are a giant company like Google or ClosedAi chatgpt

And yea, Onlyfans and Patreon paywall content has huge potential and will be great, but most users are still used to not pay for anything on the internet and will also not do so in the next years. Just look at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/)

By the way, the [r/Piracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/) sub has been growing massivly over the past few months. Just recently cracked the 2 Mio subscriber and now already at 2.1 Mio users.

Twitter (before Elon bought it)

Of course you could earn lots of money with Twitter, but only with good timing. For example if you would have bought in 2014 at 45 or even 50, you practicly wouldn\*t have made almost any money. It only went up in the last few years, because Elon bought it. Otherwise it would have stayed down there.

Everyone always says ""Oh, it gotta be at least as much worth as Twitter which was 40 billions"" - But this was only worth that much because of the buyout which many said was way way overpriced. As you can see on this chart Twitter was mostly not worth 40 billions. So this argument sounds good but is lacking.

Twitter has had comparable user amount to Reddit. (not exactly the same, but better then comparison with SNAP)

If I invest in something, then I don\*t want to rely on insanely good timing of buying into and when to take profits. Maybe you buy in cheap but you see the trend of the ricing prises and think ""yea, the future looks great, the product is getting better, more users ...), but you don\*t realize that the stock has become way too overvalued.

Basicly all these Social media stocks crashed after Corona was over.

SNAP

It\*s a bad comparison because there is a logical reason why they can\*t grow ad revenue as reddit can: The users mostly use it for chatting and you don\*t want to have ads in your chat, otherwise you will just switch to whatsapp or instagram or whatever kids use these days.

PINS - Pinterest is more interesting and with old Twitter the better comparison because they are way more similar then Snapchat.

PINS is now worth $21.66 B. ([https://companiesmarketcap.com/pinterest/marketcap/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/pinterest/marketcap/))

RDDTs Marcet cap is now currently $23.19 B [https://companiesmarketcap.com/reddit/marketcap/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/reddit/marketcap/)

Now RDDT is attractive because it has way more users then PINS and in all the things which already have been discussed a lot way more potential then PINS. The valuation now seems attractive in a comparison. PINS is not in a hype at all, so it should be good for comparisons.

I am not Expert with PINS. I asked several Chatbots to compare these two and what exactly went wrong with Pinterest.

It seems that since 2022 the users growh has been slowing down of the monthly active users. Sounds similar. This has been happening to Reddit recently and will always be a huge danger for shert term price also in the future because of too high growth expectations and hype.

More competition with Tiktok and Instagram for PINS.

Reddit is not directly competing as much with these platforms, so this shouldn\*t be such a huge issue for RDDT. Reddit is more based on Text and like a Forum.

Pinterest is just pictures.

The new ad formats and ad tools which have been introduced by PINS hasn't found as much acceptance by the people who do ad campagnes.

The strategy of PINS now seems to be the integration with e commerce to directly buy the product. This already has been discussed in this sub here and will also be probably done by reddit in the future. (It\*s not a priority according to the recent calls) This e commerce integration seems to take more time then expected.

""**Monetization Challenges**: Despite a substantial user base, Pinterest has struggled to effectively monetize its platform. The company's heavy reliance on advertising revenue makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in advertising spend, especially during economic downturns or shifts in marketing trends.""

""**Pinterest**: As of January 2025, Pinterest's global monthly active users (MAUs) reached 537 million, marking an 11% year-over-year increase."" - I have never know anyone who has ever used that platform, but okay.

The issue also seems to be that Pinterest hasn't been able to attract those big advertisers that constantly run ad campaigns. Reddit is starting to get more of those big names in and already has been sucessful in this (at least to my current knowledge).

Summary of PINS: Similar problem - growth can slow down - more users doesn\*t automaticly translate into more ad revenue per user - diffictulty to compete with big more advanced advertisers like META, Google, Tiktok, Insta.

If I would want to run an ad campaign I probably also would just go to google or Meta because these are know. I guess that most marketing people currently don\*t see Reddit at the same level as an option to run their ads there, because of lacking features out of the perspective of someone who is used to the great suites of Google and Meta. (I am not an expert in this) This is also a chance for Reddit to copy the same things those big guys are doing to make it easier for people to advertise. This must also work about branding.

If you look at companies or organisations, in the last year everyone and their mother has created a tiktok account and started advertising there, because of the hype. Tiktok became a name that became so important, that even as an old person you couldn\*t avoid it. Look at all these politicans posting weird tiktoks. Look at all these companies advertising there, because they hope to profit from the hype. Every institution or politican has a tiktok, insta, even X or nowadays bluesky account. Many even have Threads, but nobody has Reddit. Literally nobody. I know Reddit is a community and not a I follow this guy platform, but this is also a huge reason why not so many people advertise here compared to the big platforms.

\-Reddit has to also become a name you can\*t avoid as an advertiser. I don\*t know how we can get there. Maybe other platforms will get worse and thats why people start advertising more on Reddit for the community and the engagement, because it can be more specific.

So if we break it down to what can\*t happen for the stock to suceed long term:

\-user growth slowing down

\-expected Revenue can't be delivered because more users doesn\*t mean more revenue per user

\-competition with big ad brands (out of the perspective of an advertiser, not of the content platform itself for its users)

\-short term hypes (you buy in when its overvalued and it never ever goes back to this level again)

\-stock going sideways and staying on the same level as Pinterest

!! You had a lot of opportunity cost because you could have also invested in a stock which brings returns!!

So, I know this is not well structured and too long, but yea, thats what it is.

# Why will RDDT not become the next PINS, TWTR, SNAP or other social media company that wasn*t able to grow monetization as fast as expected and is not a just buy and hold stock until it recovers?

1jbfy1n,Critic needed on the following strategy,"tl;dr Divest from US equities and reallocate capital into low-cost, diversified index funds in non-US markets. Currently 70% in US markets and 20% in International, 10% Bonds. Flip that to 60% International, 20% US, 10% Bonds. 

Also, this is not investment advice, please be careful!

Rationale:

US stocks currently represent about 50% of global equity market capitalization. However, when you factor in corporate debt, the full picture changes significantly. A company’s enterprise value is calculated by adding its market capitalization to its debt. For example, a company with a $200 million market cap and $70 million in debt has an enterprise value of $270 million. This adjustment implies that American companies effectively account for roughly 70% of global equity value, leaving about 30% for the rest of the world.

Given the current economic climate in the United States, major indexes like the S&P 500 and NASDAQ may not offer sufficient diversification. US stocks are trading at elevated valuations and are likely to experience stagnant returns over the next five to ten years. In contrast, international markets—particularly European stocks—are currently more attractively priced, presenting a compelling investment opportunity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jbfy1n/critic_needed_on_the_following_strategy/,1741990560.0

1jb9uns,What’s Your Take on the Federated Hermes MDT Large Cap Growth ETF (FLCG)?,"i’ve been looking into the Federated Hermes MDT Large Cap Growth ETF (FLCG) and wanted to see if anyone here has thoughts or experience with it.

Quick summary for those not aware: FLCG was launched on July 30, 2024, and is benchmarked against the Russell 1000 Growth Index. As of February 28, 2025, it has $11.8 million in assets under management. The fund has had a -7.32% year-to-date performance as of March 12, 2025. It carries a 0.49% gross expense ratio and a 0.39% net expense ratio. The ETF is managed by MDT Advisers at Federated Hermes and follows a large-cap growth strategy, focusing on stocks expected to deliver above-average growth.

The fund is still relatively new, and while its strategy seems sound, its AUM is still low, which raises some concerns about liquidity and sustainability. Given its negative YTD performance, do you see this as just short-term volatility, or does it signal deeper concerns about the fund’s selection criteria and overall approach?

Also, with a 0.39% net expense ratio, how does this compare to other large-cap growth ETFs in terms of cost efficiency vs. performance? Would you favor FLCG over more established alternatives like VUG or QQQ?

Would love to hear your insights! Are you holding or avoiding this ETF? What do you think its long-term potential looks like?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jb9uns/whats_your_take_on_the_federated_hermes_mdt_large/,1741974364.0

1jb9ba5,Why is it a bad idea to take your money out of the market if you are expecting a downturn?,"Basically as the title states…

Let’s say you were 100% invested in VOO/VTI and decided to sell all of your stocks when Trump started levying tariffs.

Say you sold a little below the S&P500’s all time high of 6147.

You could hold out and wait for a bit and re-buy in if the price hits ~5000 for example. If it eventually goes back up to 6147 you just made roughly 20% more than people who didn’t pull their money out.

And if you are wrong, you can just throw it all back in when it reaches ~6000 and you basically end up doing no worse than people who never sold. 

For tax-advantaged accounts (401k, Roth, etc.) the only negative I can see in this strategy is the loss of dividend payments… so keeping your money out too long is probably a bad idea. But keeping it out for a few months doesn’t seem like a bad move at all.

The Buffets of the world, patiently sitting on a vast amount of loose funds, just waiting to buy stuff up, are few and far between. I understand how they would benefit.

1jazlfx,$XP Ponzi scheme relealed,"Following up on the leaked report from Hindenburg Research about the possible Ponzi scheme at $XP [(source](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/xp-shares-tumble-on-rumored-hindenburg-short-report-93CH-3822991))—yesterday we were finally blessed with the official report from Grizzly Research ([source](https://grizzlyreports.com/xp-entire-profits-are-dependent-on-what-insiders-call-a-madoff-like-ponzi-scheme/)), showing that XP's entire profits come from what insiders call a Madoff-like Ponzi scheme.

Some weren’t surprised by this revelation, including myself. As a Brazilian and former XP client, I’ve been watching reports of massive client losses for months. Several YouTubers have also shared their horror stories with $XP, such as this one titled ""[I OWE 100,000 REAIS to XP Investimentos](https://youtu.be/VwL2GW382uc?feature=shared)"". The video is in Portuguese, but basically, the guy explains how an ""investment advisor"" misled him into buying a ""COE,"" which is a Brazilian financial product designed to rip off unsuspecting investors.

Another interesting fact: any random person can become an XP ""investment advisor"", since it’s not an employment contract. You just need to bring in clients with money to invest in their products. Of course, these advisors get a nice commission, regardless of whether their clients lose everything.

To top it off, today $XP announced that they will sue Grizzly Research, triggering the infamous Streisand effect with lots of news  about it.

The funniest part? XP grew into Brazil’s most respected brokerage, practically exclusive to the wealthy, and was synonymous with quality—just like Madoff, haha.

Also, up until recently, XP was partly owned by Brazil’s largest bank, Itaú, which held a 50% stake. But over the past 1-2 years, Itaú completely liquidated its position. I found it odd at the time—why would they sell out of such a ""great business""? Now it’s crystal clear why.

Anyway, I’m curious to see where this goes. I hope XP burns in the hell it never should have crawled out of.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jazlfx/xp_ponzi_scheme_relealed/,1741942879.0
1jayqap,Advice what to do with investments.,"Hi all,

Looking for some ideas/advice on what to do with my investments/pension.

What would you do in my situation?

55 year old male in the UK, looking/hoping to possibly early retire in the next3/4 years.

Kids have left home, we have zero debt, house is paid off and worth about £400k, we will hopefully downsize and release £100k from that.

Got a stocks and shares ISA with Vanguard with about £80k in it, this has lost about £6k in the space of a month, I have cashed in £50k from it (left it in the account to invest in the future) which was in the S&P 500 and a worldwide stocks ETF.

I have about £265k in a private pension with Royal London, which again has lost about £20k over the last month, would you be looking to move what is in here into safer things like bonds?

Ive been on the Royal London site and its not the easiest site to navigate, my pension seems to be in 4 funds - American tilt, far east ex Japan, sustainable leaders and European, so at first glance it seems pretty well diversified.......... but when retirement is on the horizon, things are getting worrying at the moment.

Is it time to seek out a good IFA? what would you be doing in my position as it is?

1jawkrr,Will tariffs cause supply chain gridlock?,"This is a concern of mine but I’m not sure I’m seeing it from all sides and would welcome any input. 

My concern is that due to supply chain complexity, tariffs won’t simply raise the price on imported goods, it will create gridlock for goods that have multiple components and/or multiple back-and-forth border crossings.

Think of it like a freeway with a lot of cars, but moving pretty smoothly at 60mph. Then suddenly 20% of the cars are going 45 mph. And 5% of the cars stop altogether. This doesn’t just slow everyone down a bit, it locks up the whole freeway. 

I think the supply chains for most goods are currently like this. Most or all imported goods will face tariffs - this will cause price increases, but some suppliers may back off of selling to the US altogether. This will cause manufacturers to pivot to other alternatives, many of which will get quickly overwhelmed and cannot supply the demand. Some foreign suppliers will simply refuse to do business with the US. 

Just a few of these “stopped cars” will gridlock the entire system of international manufacturing and transportation, and I don’t think this is something the administration or the market seems to be taking into full account.

Am I being overly simplistic or pessimistic here? Is this not a valid concern?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jawkrr/will_tariffs_cause_supply_chain_gridlock/,1741929528.0

1jau5ms,Why don’t we diversify our portfolios beyond equities/fixed income?,"I see the VOO and chill method, the Boglehead 3 fund portfolio, 60/40 portfolio, 9/10 portfolio, and single stock portfolio. 

Even though all of the above are good choices, they are fundamentally missing commodities. 

Now I’m not a major advocate for gold or silver, but many economists argue gold will catch up to the levels of DEBT that have been created, just like in 1971...by some estimation, this could be as high as $35,000 per ounce at the current debt levels. This doesn’t include the reverse repo market or shadow banks.

Even while underperforming equities, gold still nearly doubled in the past 10 years, only a taste of what’s possible to come. The gold market has not caught up to the amounts of toxic debt printing the entire equities market ran behind the scenes. 

No doubt VOO is a ""strong"" investment for now, but who knows until when? And when the game is over, anyone holding gold will not lose as big; if you hold only equities or bonds, you risk holding fiat currency in the end, when the debt crisis hits the fan. Hold gold or silver, you never need to worry.

If you look at the chart of gold vs the S&P 500, gold actually caught up to the S&P 500’s pace in the 2010-2011 time period. 

Since then, the S&P has out paced gold, but if you look at the historical ratios of outperformance, gold is set to “catch up” very soon - a reversion to the mean. 

Not promoting either side here, just pointing out that it might be time to diversify your portfolio a bit by looking at long term trends and consider other strategies of growing/protecting your wealth.

I don't really believe in the ""buy the dip"" mentality. I believe in deploying cash into the market when there is CERTAINTY. Currently, there are too much UNCERTAINTY around our economy and what is going on in DC. Layoffs are rising, unemployment is going to get worse, tariff impacts on inflation won't be felt for another 3-6 months, Geopolitical tension, etc. 

The media reporting that Trump is intentionally pushing the US into recession has a lot of validity. I won't be surprised if the Nasdaq gets under 15,000 in the coming months, the S&P 500 falls to under 5,200, and the Dow gets to 35,000, aka, recession. These are just my thoughts.

1jacsnj,Employee stock purchase programs,"My employer is a Fortune 50 offering a 10% discount on stock via an employee stock purchase program.  I had maxed this out a few years ago and accumulated quite a few shares that have since increased in value.  I paused using this program after the price increased a lot and my timing was certainly positive.  With the current market turmoil and uncertainty the price has dropped and I think it might continue to do so for a while.

One of the gotchas with this program is that you contribute via deductions from your paycheck and, at the end of a quarter, the stock is bought at market price -10%.  Obviously this is good if the market price at that time happens to be a dip, but it could be a peak.  Also, the stock goes into a taxable trading account and you are responsible for taxes on the discount.  There are no restrictions from me selling as soon as the shares settle for a 10% gain minus short term capital gain taxes.

I'm confident in my company's ability to perform over the long term and I don't plan on selling any shares for quite some time.  So, I'm ok with weathering any short term price decreases.

I'd like to get opinions from this sub about how much, if at all, members take advantage of their stock purchase programs.

1ja9z5h,"""Past performance doesn't indicate future results"" vs ""time in the market beats timing the market""","People love to parrot ""time in the market beats timing the market"" around a lot these days to deride people who are exiting. But doesn't that go against the other truism of ""Past performance doesn't indicate future results"" ?

Here's the core problem: ""time in the market"" depends on the assumption that the market – especially the US stock market – will keep marching upward over the long haul. People are basically leaning on the idea that past performance will guarantee future results. The underlying conclusion? The market will inflate endlessly, so you might as well park your money in US equities and call it a day.

But what if that's not true? Let's be real: the US has held a pretty unprecedented position in the global hierarchy for decades, particularly since WW2. Free trade, stable governance, and a massive consumer-driven economy have made it the de facto ""safe haven"" for the world's wealth. It's been an environment that heavily favours investors, fuelled by policies and norms that protect capital and encourage entrepreneurialism. Or at least that was the game plan until roughly two months ago.

Things are shifting now, fast. The global economic order that underpinned US dominance is under siege. We're watching protectionist measures surge, geopolitical tensions heat up, and the overall stability that investors used to take for granted is definitely not a sure thing anymore. Worst case, we might even be on the cusp of watching the US morph into one of those “faux democracies” (like Russia or Turkey), where they still do elections but only pretend to be free and fair. That’s hardly an environment where you can just assume indefinite growth and bulletproof rule of law.

And that’s the problem with the old “time in the market beats timing the market.” It depends on the belief that the past is always prologue – that America will maintain its position, its strong institutions, its global leadership. But being top dog in the global economy isn’t some birthright that can’t be forfeited. It’s earned…and it can be lost. Especially if the US lurches toward a system where power is concentrated, institutions are weakened, and allies (or entire supply chains) get burned in the process.

Japan looked unstoppable in the ’80s; then it stagnated for decades. The UK was the global financial centre for hundreds of years; now it’s not. Why should the US be immune, particularly with internal political chaos and external challenges are piling up? If trust in the rule of law collapses or there's a leader who openly sidesteps democratic checks, how confident can you be in American markets as the ultimate safe haven?

None of this means the global stock market won’t rise over time – but it does mean that where those gains happen could radically shift. Maybe emerging markets become the new kings. Maybe commodities surge amid world turmoil. Maybe some emerging tech or decentralised ecosystem ends up being the safe bet we haven’t even considered yet. You can’t just close your eyes and assume “staying in” is always the best move. That’s blind faith, and we’re past the point where faith alone can carry the day.

And to be clear, I’m not trying to doomsay or, god forbid, even encourage anyone to pull out their investments. I’m just pointing out that blindly assuming the market will always recover - just because it always *has* - is a fallacy and a risk in itself. And maybe, just maybe, the people who *have* pulled their money out for the time being aren’t clueless idiots, but just people who have actually looked at the storm clouds gathering on the horizon and decided to hedge their bets. Maybe, at the very least, people could be a little less condescending to them.

If the game itself is changing, then clinging to the old rules feels like a losing proposition. The market might still “go up” in some form, but there's no guarantee that US equities will remain the biggest engine of global growth indefinitely – especially if American political stability continues to unravel. Past performance is not a promise, and this could be the moment we all finally learn it.

For the record, I'm still adding my monthly pension contributions to VUSA, but my existing piles (about £10k worth as I'm young and poor) were taken out more or less at the peak when Trump announced his original tariffs and showed he was serious about compromising America's position in the world. I'm also in the UK, so exchange rates are a factor for me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ja9z5h/past_performance_doesnt_indicate_future_results/,1741866038.0

Looking at more detail the fund does well when US rates drop and does poorly when they climb. It's paying a dividend of just under 7% so even if the fund value slid sideways we would be happy. 

My question is, with Trump tarrifs causing waves in the local US and global economy, what will happen to US interest rates? If inflation starts to show it's ugly head, would the FED step in and raise rates as a result of the tarrifs or would they hold steady/continue cutting as the tarrifs seem to be very much up the air.

1ja1cq1,"Trump: New travel barriers for Canadian tourists, the biggest source of US tourism. Expect impact on hospitality stocks - airlines, hotels, retail, restaurants, car rentals, parks, REITs","Today the Trump administration announced new visitation barriers for Canadian tourists. Any tourists staying longer than 30 days must register and provide fingerprints to authorities. How many Canadians actually vacation longer for 30 days+ in the US you may ask?

* **1 million snowbirds (Canadian tourists travelling to the US to avoid Canadian winters) reportedly contributed around $6.5b to Florida's economy alone during just a 6 month period**
* **Canadians were the largest visitors to the US comprising of \~30% of all US tourist visits in 2023.**
* Those tourists with billions in combined disposable income just had it harder to come to the US to spend their money
* While this policy in isolation may not have a material impact, combined with instigating a trade war and threats of annexation seemed to have turned off many Canadians (rightfully so) on spending a single penny in the US.
* Since Canada was the only country previously exempted from this rule, reversing this is policy is leaving many Canadians feeling further alienated by the US, especially given their economic contributions to local US economies

I'm bearish for Q2, Q3, and potentially Q4 for the following industries

* **REITs**: NNN REIT, Drop in tourism will bankrupt many small US businesses with thin margins in the restaurant industry. While you can't make investment moves on small businesses, this will lead to defaulting on their leases and commercial REITs that focus on restaurants will have high vacancy rates.
* **Hotels:** Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Air Bnb, Caesars Entertainment
* **Airlines:** American, Delta, United, Air Canada,
* **QSRs:** Darden Restaurants, Texas Roadhouse, Brinker International (food chains primarily with US locations attract tourists due to the novelty factor of not being able to go in Canada)
* **Amusement Parks**: Disney, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, United Parks & Resorts
* **Car Rentals:** Enterprise, Hertz, Avis
* **Retail**: TJX Companies, Ross, Macys, Kohls, Target (retail stores with no presence in Canada are often attract tourists who are interested in shopping at retail stores they can't back in Canada)
* **Energy**: Shell, Chevron, Exxon (lots of Canadian tourists do road trips and gas up in the US, but since these companies also operate in Canada and Canadians are just going to replace their US road triups with Canadian ones, I do not believe they will be impacted

Other factors to consider before making moves

* Can US consumer spending or tourists from other countries fill the economic void Canadian tourists will leave in the tune of billions of dollars?
* Will other countries follow suite, either as a response to the US administrations polices, or in a sign of solidary with Canadians?
* Even if positive relations are restored between US-Canada by the end of the year, will that change souring Canadian consumer sentiment to US businesses and travel?

In no way is this post a dig at Canadians for deciding to stop visiting. I am also Canadian. This post is a purely from a finance/stock perspective on which industries will get negatively impacted by this administrations policies the most so that people here can adjust their portfolio allocations accordingly if they have exposure into said industries. Vive la Canada!

1ja03q0,Leverage against a Canadian RRSP account?,"I’m a Canadian investor who recently moved to Questrade platform from TD Bank. 

Last week I made a “market” trade for $170k in my RRSP account an hour before the markets opened. When the markets opened the price was higher, instead of reducing my buy quantity Questrade unknowingly to me leveraged my RRSP account in the amount of $8,000. So i was minus $8,000 cash in my account. I didn’t notice this and there was no email or notification letting me know they did this. 4 days after the trade I get an email saying I need to add $8,000 to my account to cover the money they gave me, or sell $8,000 in stock to cover it. 

I can’t add $8,000 to my account because my RRSP contribution is maxed. 

The only option they are giving me is to sell $8,000 of stock. That trade is down %12, if I sell I’m out roughly $1,200. I’m not an active trader, so either my account down right now I would simply be waiting this out until the market goes up. 

My understanding is that you are NOT aloud to leverage registered account. That’s a CSR rule, in my 10 plus years with TD, they would always reduce my RRSP trade QTY to an amount where they could fill the order. 

What options do I have here? Questrade gave me a “customer success” person who essentially said Questrade did nothing wrong here. But they need me to pay back this $8k “immediately”. If they did nothing wrong, I told them to let the $8k sit and I’ll pay the annual 8% interest. But they said no, I need to bring the account to $0 immediately. 

Any suggestions here? I feel like this is a glitch in their system and that’s why they need me to pay it back ASAP. For regulatory purposes my trade should have never happened.

1j9ygro,Remembering stock market crash of 2022,"It’s easy to forget how short the market’s memory is.

Still remember the last few months of 2022. The S&P 500 was down nearly 25%, the Nasdaq had crashed over 35%, and inflation was out of control. The Fed was hiking rates aggressively, and it felt like a deep recession was inevitable.

Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan (don't remember which) predicted the S&P 500 would go all the way to 3,000. Michael Burry suggested an even bigger collapse taking S&P500 back to 1800. Most investors were convinced this was just the beginning of more pain. Even then people talked about stagflation and going into the lost decade.

Meta, in particular, was the poster child of despair. Down 75%, from $380 to $88. People genuinely thought it would never recover. The ad market was dying. Reels weren’t making money. Zuckerberg was ""burning billions"" on the metaverse. Investors wanted him to shut it all down.

It wasn’t just Meta. Amazon reported its first unprofitable year after a long time. Google’s ad revenue shrank. Microsoft’s growth slowed. Tesla was down to $113 at its lowest. Institutions were slashing price targets left and right. Investors were selling at the lows, convinced things would only get worse.

And then... the market did what it always does. Slowly, things started improving. Companies adapted. Earnings stabilized. The panic faded. By mid-2023, inflation was cooling. The Fed hinted at pausing rate hikes.

Meta posted a solid earnings report. Then came $40 billion in stock buybacks. The stock doubled. Then doubled again. Amazon recovered. Nvidia went on a historic run. The Nasdaq had its best year in two decades in 2023. By early 2024, Meta, Nvidia, and Microsoft were hitting all-time highs to reach even higher by end of 2024. Two years of record gains.

When markets are crashing, it feels like they’ll never go up again. When they’re at all-time highs, it feels like they’ll never go down. Neither is true.

They seem to have good luck with them and the advisor wont charge us a direct fee for his services since they have a long standing relationship without friends and their parents and grandparents. They believe they are a fiduciary and not just a financial advisor. At Fidelity I had a roll over 401k that was in a time targeted fund. The funds the advisor likes to use are with Capital Group. The fund fees are 5.75  for the initial deposit and no more since its less than 25k invested. When I was using Fidelity I didnt have a fee that was known to me. I monitor my grandmothers Edward Jones account and she had a 401k and roth IRA and the only fees she had were with her managed account. What is expected for fees and what is high or low? This is something that I am not to familiar with and researching it doesn't give much information or I am not searching right.

Fight me if you disagree with the thesis below.

In a nutshell:

\-the **market cap ($80m) is currently largely below the net asset position value ($213m),** while the company is cash flow positive with more than **$400m+ of revenues**

\-a cost cutting plan is currently being implemented and there is a lot to cut: **the company spent $170m on R&D in 2024...**

\-the management has initiated a strategic review: ""*we are undertaking a strategic review process and exploring a range of alternatives to maximize shareholder value,* ***including being acquired, undertaking a go-private transaction***"" (this quote is from Q4 24).

\-Market cap is so low compared to the net asset value, the stock could easily do 2-3x when the outcome is announced; **Goldman Sachs has been hired**.

\-In addition, a lawsuit has been filed against Google who is previewing Chegg's content in AI-powered search (IP infringement): Chegg could get **up to c. $500m in compensatory damages** due to revenue loss caused by AI Overviews (estimated at c. $100-200m annual hit)

\-Yes, the topline is currently declining 20%: this is a similar growth profile to what is coming for Tesla... **except that we are on less than 2x P/E and less than 1x EBITDA**, while having a positive **net asset position at 3x the market cap!**

\-Finally, **the stock is highly shorted**

**This is not a financial advice, just my own analysis. I really like the stock.**

\*\*\*

**Few numbers below as of 31-Dec-24:**

\-Market cap of $80m (current market cap as of today)

\-Cash: $161m

\-Short-term investments (government bonds): $154m

\-Long-term investments (government bonds): $213m

**=> total cash + government bond position: $528m**

\-Liabilities: a convertible bond: $359 + $127 = $486m

**=> Net cash position = $42m**

\-Properties: $171m

**=> Net cash position + value of properties = $213m (2.7x the market cap!!)**",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j9rkno/chgg_20_downside_200_upside/,1741805370.0

So I'm trying to figure out how much of my long term gains that I can liquidate without paying taxes.

I make $141K/yr, which is $2,711.54 per weekly paycheck - $460.96 deducted to 401K = $2250.58 taxable. Correct?

I had 9 paychecks before the announcement, which total my taxable income to $20,255.22.

Since the announcement, I'm putting the rest of my paychecks directly into 401K. Which is what I *should* be doing, correct?

Then I'm expecting \~$10,500 severance, which I don't think that I can contribute to 401K.

I also invested $7000 into Roth IRA this year. But that doesn't effect anything until *after* I pull out, right?

I've read that I won't be taxed in LTG this year, if I made less than $48,350 total. Correct?

So I *think* that it'll be able to pull out tax free, if my LTG is less than:

$48,350 (limit) - $20,255.22 (salary - 401K) - $10,500 (severance) \~= $17,594.78

1j9gro8,"Thoughts on my portfolio focused on semiconductors, gold, and cloud retail?","
Hey everyone, I've been building a portfolio with a $500 daily investment strategy (except for SHOP at $1000 daily) and wanted to get some feedback on my thinking and potential blind spots.

My current investments:

**Semiconductor focus:**
- TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor)
- AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)

**Gold/Mining exposure:**
- GLD (SPDR Gold Shares ETF)
- RGLD (Royal Gold)
- NEM (Newmont Corporation)
- FNV (Franco Nevada)

**E-commerce:**
- SHOP (Shopify) - double investment at $1000 daily

**My reasoning:**

1. **Semiconductors (TSM, AMD)**: With AI development accelerating and computing demands increasing globally, semiconductor companies seem positioned for long-term growth. TSM provides manufacturing exposure as the world's largest foundry, while AMD gives me exposure to both CPU and GPU markets.

2. **Gold/Mining (GLD, RGLD, NEM, FNV)**: I'm allocating to gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty and inflation concerns. I've diversified within this sector with both direct gold exposure (GLD) and mining companies with different business models (traditional mining with NEM, royalty companies with RGLD and FNV).

3. **E-commerce (SHOP)**: I'm bullish on continued e-commerce growth, and Shopify seems to be winning the platform battle for small/medium businesses. I'm investing double here because I see strong growth potential.

What I'm considering:
- Is my portfolio too concentrated in semiconductors and gold?
- Should I add more geographic diversity?
- Am I missing any key sectors that would balance this approach?

Right now VIX is at 26.92. What I am planning on doing is waiting for a couple of weeks, let the whole discussion on tariffs to die down a little bit. Hopefully VIX will fall to around 20 at that point. Markets would stabilize a bit. Markets would have digested all of the negative news by that point made peace with it. Hopefully Trump doesn't rock the boat too much before April 1st. There will be a couple of positive news here and there as well. Which will help the stocks bounce back 1% to 2%.

At that point, I will buy PUTS on VOO, VTI, QQQ expiring on Jan 16th. Worse case scenario I will lose all 20K to 30K that I spend on these options as the price of the underlying securities shoots up, but at that point I am already making a significant profit. Or maybe I will spend 10K to 15K and get half of my portfolio covered. That itself will be a huge win.

And in the best case, the markets tanks by 30% to 40%. I cash out, invest that money in my home country. The markets in my home country move in lockstep with US markets.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j98uhj/what_do_you_folks_think_of_my_investing_strategy/,1741746619.0
1j98mqk,Missing the Best and Worst Days in the Market,"Not trying to make a super deep point with this post, but I just got off on a tangent thinking about the constant refrain of ""miss X number of best days and your return goes down to X bad return"" that you encounter on pretty much every investing sub around. Since we know that really good days tend to occur around the same time as really bad days, it would make more sense to talk about what would happen if you missed X number of really good and really bad days. It was actually somewhat hard to find anyone who did that math, but [these guys did](https://occaminvesting.co.uk/problems-with-the-x-best-days-argument/), and found that missing both the top and bottom 25 market days a year over time led to signficant, but not crazy, outperformance of the S&P 500.

  
IDK if that actually changes the rationale for a retail investor just buying and holding whenever possible - that idea is based on a lot more than just attaining the maximum possible return, but I do think it makes a solid case that you shouldn't feel too bad for sitting on the sidelines when the market gets volatile. Right now I'm feeling like I might have made the first good decision of my investing life selling all my tech stock 2 months ago...

1j93ucj,Tangency portfolio = market portfolio?,"This equivalence seems impossible. Let me explain, and then someone smarter than I am can say why I'm wrong.

The tangency portfolio is defined by risk and returns, whereas the market portfolio is based only on market caps. Current market caps contain NO INFORMATION about historical risk and returns. So how can they give the same result?

For example, consider an alternative universe where I replace certain stocks with versions having half their rate of return, but correspondingly longer history so that the market caps today are the same. I don't need a calculator to see that the efficient frontier will be different in this alternate universe. But the market portfolio will be the same.

We can cook up similar examples for modifying volatility. In any case, it appears that we can dramatically alter the risk and returns of our assets while maintaining current market caps.

What I do believe is the EMH, if tangency is optimal and all investors flock to this same portfolio, then the market will BECOME the tangency.

I’ve got a Stocks and Shares LISA with Moneybox as I’m currently saving up to buy my first house. I don’t have a huge amount saved at the moment but I usually put in around £350pcm and it’s set up to buy into the Vanguard S&P500 ETF.

I’m down about £100.00 at the moment - no problem. 

I plan on buying in around 2-3 years so am I best off cutting my losses now and moving to a cash LISA or do I just keep at it? I’ve come into a bit of money and I planned on maxing out my allowance for this year but I’m slightly reluctant for obvious reasons as I’m not sure 2-3 years is long enough for things to recover if it continues on a downward trend.

I know the risks involved with investing, I’m not sat tearing my hair out or running scared at the current situation as I have other ISA’s for me and my kids where I’m still invested. These are all long-term for me and I will stick with my regular deposits here. 

The cash LISA is probably the safe bet and I know I’d be at risk of missing out on any market recovery but I don’t want to wait 5-10 years if it could potentially take that long. Just looking for some sensible advice on what others would do here.

1j8mt2m,How to translate risk tolerance to a number?,"Is this a valid way to find my risk tolerance?

So we've presumably all done those risk profiling questionnaires and are eventually mapped to something like conservative, adventurous, 4 out of 5... but how are those things mapped in the first place? Who's to say that adventurous corresponds to 100% equities other than convention?

I'm exploring a different approach and would love your comments on it, but basically I'm trying to use these extreme days to measure the limits.

Basically, on a big red day, did you come close to the following:

\-deviating from your financial plan?  
\-calling your financial advisor?  
\-consider selling your investments?  
\-lose sleep or feel anxiety and stress?  
\-post some panicked thing like this on reddit\*?

If so, I'd argue you were at your tolerance limit and form there we can backward out your tolerable allocation.

For example, if I lost $25,000 on a $1,000,000 portfolio in a day and considered liquidating my investments, then a 2.5% loss in a day is my tolerance limit. I didn't break it, but I was close.

I get that bad days happen, how often can I stay the course when days like these occur? Are they acceptable every 30 days? every 100 days? every year?

Let's say I can accept a day like that every 160 days, then I can figure out my sigma which is normsinv(1/160) = 2.5 stdevs.  
Let's convert my 2.5% loss to an annualized vol with 2.5% \* sqrt(252) = 39.69%

Based on our frequency we're saying that 39.69% is 2.5 stdevs, so 1 stdev should be **15.87%**

From this annualized target volatility, we can find portfolio allocations that match our tolerance. At 15.87%, I can still do 94% equities 6% bonds.

\---

How do you guys feel about this approach? I think it's more actionable than being rated on a scale of 1-5, or ""adventurous""

\*What are the behaviors that you think mark that someone is at their risk tolerance limit?

I realize there was a wall of math text above so I made a quick app to illustrate the calculation method I was describing. [https://risk-tolerance.replit.app/](https://risk-tolerance.replit.app/)

Edit: Another thing to do could be to verify that daily limit across different time frames. For example, if $25,000 dropped in a day is a limit, how about $25,000 \* sqrt(21) = $115,000 in a month? $397,000 in a year? Just to check for consistency.

A personal example is March 2020. The first -3% day stung but I held. But after several red days of greater magnitude I buckled and definitely was beyond my risk tolerance. The time between unusually bad days was too small for me to tolerate.

Edit 2 on the daily time frame I didn't consider the expected return to simplify, but I guess that meaningfully affects the expected ""bad year"" drawdown. I'll incorporate that after more discussion on whether this methodology has legs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j8mt2m/how_to_translate_risk_tolerance_to_a_number/,1741685272.0

1j8j9i6,Withdrawing from safety net vs. liquidating investments for mortgage downpayment (US),"I'm preparing to buy a house (well, condo). I'm fortunate to have enough money in investments (stocks/ETFs) to cover the minimum downpayment and still have a decent chunk of investments left over. I also have a safety net savings account. I'm trying to decide whether I should fund the downpayment just by liquidating investments or whether it makes sense to tap into my safety net account so that I can liquidate less of my investments.

On the one hand, liquidating investments triggers capital gains, whereas withdrawing from my safety net account does not. So preferring to withdraw from my safety net would reduce my tax bill. My investments are also long-term investments and the market is in a bit of a dip right now, so it seems like a bad time to be selling investments.

But OTOH, if I deplete my safety net then I'll want to build it back up. That will take time, and during that time I'd have to cover any unexpected expenses by liquidating my investments--potentially at a time when the market could be even lower than it is now.

I'm leaning toward preferring to deplete the safety net, but I couldn't find any discussion of this situation online. What would you do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j8j9i6/withdrawing_from_safety_net_vs_liquidating/,1741669396.0
1j8igls,Recession Fears Overblown,"The main catalyst for this pullback has supposedly been trade war fears. The Atlanta GdpNow suddenly fell to negative GDP growth prediction, and everyone has lost their minds. The main cause of that change was a sudden trade deficit caused by an influx of gold imported by investors in trade arbitrage with the UK. In other words, it is a huge mis-print that will be corrected in final GDP numbers. There is no other reason to believe our GDP will significantly retract in Q1. It's all smoke and mirrors, in my opinion. Excellent write-up below. It is a normal reset of valuation.

Bonus total $12,200 before taxes. 

I’ll try to hit the max by end of the year, but the bonus is a way to accelerate that and hit it sooner.

1j8em9q,“Past performance does not guarantee future success” but about macroeconomics,"The conventional wisdom about investing is that even after downturns, recovery is inevitable. The advice is therefore to not panic sell, because over any sufficiently long timescale (~decadal) the probability of losing money in a properly diversified portfolio historically is very low. While I am not disagreeing with this premise, I just want to weigh in as a physical scientist: such an argument based on such limited data would not be accepted as scientific fact by scientists. The underlying principle assumes that exponential growth of the US economy is inevitable over the long term, again an assumption that has never been rigorously proven. 

The same conventional wisdom will tell you that just because a particular company has achieved X% returns over the past few years, that does not imply that those returns will continue into the future. I am simply suggesting that the same advice could POSSIBLY be relevant to the American economy writ large. 

To be clear, I am not cashing out my personal positions. I believe the companies I am personally invested in are resilient enough to withstand the coming storm.

Anyway, here’s a simple sample strategy I came up with which I wanted to share and also get other investor’s opinions on.

-5%… reinvest 10%

-10%… reinvest 10%

-15%… reinvest 10%

-20%… reinvest 10%

-25%… reinvest 10%

-30%… reinvest 10%

-35%… reinvest 10%

-40%… reinvest 10%

-45%… reinvest 10%

-50%… reinvest 10%

The caveat to the above strategy obviously is if the economic condition changes significantly in a positive way, I might make the decision to throw all of the remainder back in immediately.

My naive assumption for that would be he would employ lots of deals for his buddies, along with the prominence of Bezos, Zuckerberg etc being at the inauguration, good times ahead for tech etc. (not necessarily the country) … The drop that happened last week would have seemed more reasonable to have happened at that time instead what with the chaos that should be of no surprise at all? 

The major ‘turning point’ it seemed was when he berated Zelensky at the Oval Office, but more than that, repeated Putin’s own talking points which in some ways is a much more scarier scenario than just him making the typical outrageous claims he does. 

I get that lots of people are saying he’s just making it up as he goes along, but even for a madman, there must be a rationale, which for him, is exclusively self-serving, but how exactly in his mind does this benefit him if the stock markets crash / country goes into recession? One ‘reasonable’ answer I think could be that it’s just a ploy to stay in power  by creating so much chaos that’s too difficult to tidy up / make sense of.

I'm still in college, and I'm sure I'll be fine when I get a job and graduate, but I prefer playing it safe and sorry.

I'm not an expert investor or anything like that, I just invest any time I've got money to spare, so I'm not sure what the best course of action would be, especially now. Should I wait for it to decline further? Is there anything I should keep in mind if I do transfer? Any bit of advice helps.

Was thinking I needed to get a new one. However, I was able to get the damages repaired for only $2000. I took good care of the car and took the risk of keeping it and hoping it will keep running ('03 Acura TL 168,000 miles)

I am anticipating I will need to buy a new car at some point and feel like I should begin saving. I'm looking to stay around $25k.

My question is: What is the best way to save? 

\- Should I put money into my individual brokerage? 

\- Should I keep in HSYA? My fear is that my car runs for another 5 years and I miss out on having that money in the market.

\- Should I not keep money on hand and just take out a loan whenever I need to buy the car.

1j823mc,Why do emerging markets ETFs trail US Total Market when their GDPs are largely higher?,"So as a young person I have been investing about 80% in US equities and 20% in international/emerging markets, since I'm betting on global diversification and growth in those markets. I also look at GDP growth in places like China, India, etc, and see that they are largely outpacing the US. However, that is not translating to returns that outpace the US



For example looking at FSKAX (US Total Markets)

17.50% 1 year, 11.54% 3 year, 16.05% 5 year, 12.30% 10 year annualized returns

Then looking at FPADX (Emerging Equities - about 65% composed of China/India/Taiwan)

9.98% 1 year, 0.30% 3 year, 3.89% 5 year, 3.23% 10 year annualized return

  
What am I not understanding? I realize that these are just baskets of individual holdings, but I would expect to see these emerging markets doing better than they are. Is this a matter of more money being pumped into the US so prices are rising faster even if GDP is going slower? Is GDP just flat out a wrong proxy to be thinking out potential market growth?

But what about smaller cryptos that aren't as popular BUT have more interesting real-world uses? Or different kinds of tech that have potential? You can go very wrong with these, sure, but if you get one or two that actually prove to be good, it's an even better investment than stablecoins, right?

You have things like the [world network](https://world.org/), which uses global identity verification to ""AI-proof"" transactions (pretty relevant right now), or Chainlink with smart contract data that can actually solve real problems.

""Two years ago we were selling at 10 times revenues when we were at $64. At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don't need any transparency. You don't need any footnotes. What were you thinking?""

1j7wcsv,What is your strategy for entering trades?,"I would say that 90% of trading is just what you enter at. The result of any trade is hinged entirely on that number; whether you lose money or make money is just the difference between your entry and your exit so it is something very important to analyze. If you disagree with that please let me know why.

So the reason why I am asking this question is to get some insight into the world as I know how I enter and what tools I use but I am always open to learning how other people make decisions. My particular method begins with the end in mind; I know what I want to sell for and know what that return is so I build the price in reverse and thus set a limit order for that price; if that price never hits I am out nothing and just move on but if the price takes I then have a solid get what I am seeking to acquire. By no means do I use any complex mathematics but I do use some probability and light tree work to see when I should let a trade go. 

For people who DCA specifically do you have any specific times you choose to align to? For instance if you know that a company pays dividends in a period which lowers the price by the cost of the dividend\* do you use that information to buy at that point? Or are you time insensitive and instead DCA more often to remove volatility, such as weekly (or even daily) versus monthly or quarterly? I find it interesting but I don't actually practice DCA so I am curious how it has worked out.

* $8,000 in FHSA contribution room

If I have $100 just to invest as my starting point, would you recommend investing or just take the $100 and put it towards something else?

1j7lguw,"TSLA being investigated for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars. They claimed that just 4 dealerships sold 8,600+ cars in 3 days.","The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653 Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

Investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation yet of official wrongdoing yet. Regardless of the findings, the case for exiting a TSLA position can be made because

1. If the allegations are true, this is fraud and a Lucky Coffee chain scenario
2. If the allegations are false, =many are saying it's because Tesla reports late. Internal reporting and accounting practices seem to be in disarray for a once $1t+ company.

1j7h6z3,Comparing Gold ETCs  to understand their qualitative difference,"Hello,

I'm looking at:

- [SGLP](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B579F325)
- [SGLN](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B4ND3602)

They both have 0.12% TER, and their returns seem identical as they both track the spot price of gold (in USD). Both seem to be domiciled in Ireland. EDIT 1: one issued by Invesco and the other one iShares (originally wrote both are Invesco).

The question then is, what is their difference?

In the description of SGLP:

> The ETC replicates the performance of the underlying index with a collateralised debt obligation which is backed by physical holdings of the precious metal. 

And for SGLN:

> The iShares Physical Gold ETC is the largest ETC that tracks the Gold index. The ETC replicates the performance of the underlying index with a collateralised debt obligation which is backed by physical holdings of the precious metal. 

I am curious as to how I should interpret this. Both seem to use ""collateralised debt obligation"" which seems to suggest that they are not 100% physical gold backed, but rather structure their debt in some type of way. Is that significant?

In short:

1. How are they really different?
2. What could I read in the justETF page to spot the difference?

EDIT 2: I do not think justETF is enough to dive into the details here. I have now gone to their issuers (after noticing they are not both Invesco):

Market is currently at an inflection point.","[17 days ago, I posted about how $8M worth of VIX 24/25 calls ](https://www.reddit.com/r/OptionsMillionaire/comments/1iu39uc/heavy_vix_calling_earlier_this_week_last_time_we/)were bought over the course of three days. That day, I posted one of my first YT shorts saying this had parallels between what we saw in  the first carry trade shake-out in August 2024 (massive calls were bought in mid-July at relatively same order of magnitude). This call/these calls were effectively the top.

[115,000ish contracts bought at $0.75ish at the VIX C24.](https://preview.redd.it/8yhz6chmypne1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6761b624aac73af2cf364036c669eaf593c74226)

  
 It looks like that trader has taken *some* off the table (67% of the contracts, sold at a 180% profit). Cleared $8M in gains and still has 32% of their position running.

[77,000ish contracts sold at $2.10ish](https://preview.redd.it/68dpvbwuypne1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4008437032cc2a1fa7618e1977e15abf0e533e53)

I argued that this was a trader betting on more pain ahead. The market tanked another 3% since.

[Today, these are marked at break-even\(ish\). But we did have a big Vix vacuum on Friday and before that these perceived lotto ticket\/hedges were up anywhere from 10-15&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/w6opo570zpne1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=af19621a9c7e46bbb26625ff85562400c8db79ec)





Point being, though some counter-argued saying that these could be hedges against massive huge AUM, I am still of the opinion that someone out there knew that the market was going to be sell-off to a degree. Since then, all major indices have reverted back to the 200D MA. Puts have paid off.

 

[The market is at a critical juncture. Watch this closely as we may be at an inflection point.](https://preview.redd.it/542fsbb2zpne1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b181675dfc8b7203e21c5b9c1e5d9cf5c617ae69)

 

 

 

What’s next? Hard to say. Buying puts at these levels at elevated volatility means you’re risking more to make less (insurance/puts are expensive), even if you’re directionally right. Personally, I think we’re at the beginning of a deflationary cycle as evidenced by things like $WMT, $COST earnings showing consumer weakness, Oil and $IWM has gotten bodied and job market is softening, to name a few. “The economy is fine”, says JPOW, well – it looks pretty fucking far from fine.

 $TLT calls and the index itself is now my main play. We saw some aggressive $TLT action last week, and IV is still relatively low. Trump may not be able to force the Fed’s hand, but his tariff flip-flopping and public sector job cuts could shake up markets. Yes, tariffs are inflationary, but the rapid policy shifts could create short-term deflationary pressure—leading investors to a *flight to quality* in Treasuries.

Also, if rates don’t go lower. We’re fucked.

Wild times.

 TL:DR –

* Trader who bet on volatility (Feb 19) effectively called the top (Feb 20). Market has been in shambles since, but betting on more downside is very expensive.
* The stock market is currently at a key technical level (200MA), and these are key levels to watch in the next week.
* The bond market is all over the place, but the economy is showing signs of weakness and I suspect rates should head lower.

1j797km,Selling stocks to go on holiday,"Hello all,

26m, London, £30k annual salary (expected pay rise for the next tax year) with a stable accounting job. The salary is such as I only started about 18 months ago and doing exams to become qualified.

I have been fortunate enough to have maxed out my £20k Individual Savings Account (ISA - tax free investment/ savings wrapper) allowance for 2024/2025, with money is in the Vanguard FTSE All-World and S&P500. This has been made possible with the fortunate position of not paying rent at home and only financially contribute with some family shopping. I am pretty frugal in my spending in terms of the basics such as not eating/ drinking out and planning WFH days on when my dad drives into work (my workplace is enroute his journey and allows for good 1-2-1 bonding time). This does not stop me from socialising with friends, occasional trips abroad and even contributing towards a special bday trip for my parents to some states in USA earlier in the tax year.

There is about 2 weeks off from work this month, in which I have pondered about going on a last minute holiday to Brazil without dipping into my ISA. The initial plan was to put this money towards maxing out my LISA asap for the 2025/26 allowance and letting the money accrue in a HYSA for the time being, however I have stupidly put the money into an invest account with money in the the Vanguard FTSE All-World and S&P500. Since putting the money in, I have lost about £150. My concern now is taking the money out and humbly taking the loss of £150 and pay for the holiday within my budget or wait it out in the longterm.

Additionally. I am not too worried about a rainy day stash of money. Most of this months salary can just be allocated to emergency savings then added to my ISA from the end of April instead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j797km/selling_stocks_to_go_on_holiday/,1741531858.0

1j6jbvv,"Are stock valuations simply a product of investor belief in scarcity? If we treat stocks as a store of value, like Bitcoin, gold, or even Tesla, does that make traditional macroeconomic analysis less relevant?","I have been thinking about how we value stocks and why traditional macroeconomic analysis still holds water in today’s markets. Typically, stocks are evaluated using earnings, growth rates, interest rates, and other economic indicators. Yet, oftentimes prices seem driven more by narrative and investor sentiment than by fundamentals.

Tesla offers an example. At times, its stock price has soared far beyond what traditional metrics might justify. Much of its valuation appears linked to the story of its potential to revolutionize energy and transportation. Many see Tesla not simply as an auto manufacturer but as an innovation pioneer. Its market value then reflects the belief that investing in Tesla secures a piece of a scarce, transformative opportunity.

Consider Bitcoin. Its appeal stems largely from its fixed supply. Investors treat it as digital gold, a scarce asset that preserves value even though it does not generate revenue. Similarly, gold is prized not for income but for its long history as a reliable store of value, especially in uncertain times.

This leads me to ask: if investors increasingly view stocks as stores of value like Bitcoin or gold, does that lessen the importance of macroeconomic fundamentals? 

Are we increasingly buying into a narrative based on scarcity rather than relying on hard economic data? 

Is there a shift in perspective underway and would it be sustainable or will traditional fundamental analysis remain crucial for evaluating investments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j6jbvv/are_stock_valuations_simply_a_product_of_investor/,1741447196.0

For the most part, because of sentiment mostly, I've not touched it at all, only selling off just enough shares to be able to make my yearly RMD, shoving any scraps of what was leftover from that RMT into FXAIX.  My father's passing is now long enough ago now that I've started thinking about what to actually do with this account.  I think my options are :

* Cash it all out now and close out the account, pay taxes on withdrawal, and use the money to pay off debt and/or open an investment account or HYSA.
* Sell all of the GOOG and reinvest in other things. (Taking out only RMD)
* Sell some of the GOOG and reinvest in other things. (Taking out only RMD)
* Leave it all alone. (Taking out only RMD)

Since it is an inherited IRA, I have to take the RMD yearly, or pay penalties. Are there any other options I am missing?  Which seems the wisest thing to do of those options?

I’m looking for feedback on a very aggressive 401(k) allocation I’m considering. I have a fairly long time horizon, want maximum growth, and don’t mind being hands-on with rebalancing. My idea is a 95% stock / 5% bond mix with the following funds:

* **U.S. Large Cap (40%)**: Schwab S&P 500 Index
* **U.S. Mid Cap (15%)**: Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Admiral (or Macquarie Mid Cap Growth)
* **U.S. Small Cap (15%)**: Fidelity Small Cap Index
* **International Developed (20%)**: DFA International Core Equity 2
* **Emerging Markets (5%)**: DFA Emerging Markets
* **Bonds (5%)**: Voya Intermediate Bond I (or Empower U.S. Govt Sec)

I know 95/5 is super aggressive. My thinking:

1. **Long time horizon** → Lean heavily on equities for higher returns.
2. **Small/Mid-Cap Tilts** → Aim for extra growth potential.
3. **International + Emerging** → Diversify globally, capture EM growth.
4. **5% Bonds** → Just a small stabilizer to rebalance during drawdowns.

I’m prepared for volatility (or at least I think I am!). I’d love to hear your opinions:

* Does this seem too aggressive?
* Any thoughts on these specific funds or alternatives?
* Should I bump bonds up to 10–20%?
* How do you handle rebalancing on such an aggressive allocation?

1j5tnnr,Bath & Body Works: Strong FY2024 Performance Faces FY2025 Tariff Headwinds,"* BBWI had a strong FY2024 performance, with Q4 results surpassing expectations despite a shorter holiday calendar.
* FY2025 guidance is weaker due to new tariffs, which could impact supply chain costs and profit margins.
* Tariffs include a 25% tax on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tax on Chinese imports, affecting 17% of BBWI’s supply chain.
* The report analyzes BBWI’s financial position, tariff impact, and mitigation strategies, highlighting the company’s strong fundamentals and investment potential.

Bath & Body Works (BBWI) delivered a strong financial performance in FY2024, particularly in Q4, despite challenges such as a shorter holiday season. The company successfully leveraged promotions and cost efficiencies to sustain revenue growth and expand operating margins, demonstrating its ability to navigate a competitive retail landscape. Wall Street expectations were exceeded, with EPS and revenue outperforming cautious forecasts.

However, BBWI faces new headwinds in FY2025, with weaker-than-expected guidance largely due to the impact of newly imposed tariffs. These tariffs include a 25% tax on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tax on Chinese imports, directly affecting 17% of BBWI’s supply chain—10% from China and 7% from Canada and Mexico combined. The increased costs from these tariffs pose a potential risk to profit margins and overall earnings growth, causing investor concern. As a result, BBWI's stock has seen volatility, reflecting market apprehension about the company’s ability to offset rising costs.

The objective of this report is to assess BBWI’s financial performance, evaluate the impact of tariffs, and analyze the company’s strategies to manage these challenges. While the tariff-related cost pressures are a concern, BBWI remains fundamentally strong and undervalued. By examining FY2024 results, FY2025 projections, and broader market conditions, this report highlights BBWI’s ability to adapt to new challenges while maintaining profitability. The company’s proactive supply chain adjustments, pricing strategies, and brand strength position it to navigate current economic uncertainties effectively. As a result, despite near-term concerns, BBWI remains an attractive investment opportunity with significant growth potential.

**TL;DR:** BBWI had a strong FY2024 but faces challenges in FY2025 due to tariffs increasing costs. While this could pressure margins, the company’s strong fundamentals, cost-saving strategies, and market positioning make it an attractive investment.

1j5tl9z,"Nvidia: Rising Competition, Valuation Concerns, and Shifting AI Investments","* Nvidia peaked in June 2024 and has been in a sideways correction.
* DeepSeek's AI model and high Nvidia valuation caused a sharp stock decline.
* Cloud companies' weak performance reduced AI chip investments.
* AMD and tech giants are developing cheaper AI chips, pressuring Nvidia.
* Nvidia remains dominant but faces increasing competition and valuation concerns.



In January 2025, Chinese AI company DeepSeek made a bold move by launching a new AI model at a fraction of the cost typically required. This raised concerns about Nvidia’s market monopoly, leading to a historic one-day market cap loss of nearly $600 billion. The stock had already been struggling after peaking in June 2024, showing signs of a broader correction phase. Weak cloud profits and reduced AI hardware investments from major cloud companies added to the downturn. Despite Nvidia consistently beating earnings estimates, its high valuation has investors questioning its long-term sustainability. The company’s $2.8 trillion valuation, trading at 12.5x forward revenue for FY 2027, has been flagged as a major risk.

Nvidia’s latest earnings exceeded analyst expectations, beating EPS estimates by $0.04 and revenue estimates by $1.19 billion. Annual EPS growth remains strong, but the stock failed to rally due to external market conditions. Major hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft underperformed in cloud revenue, signaling a slowdown in AI chip investments. Investors are concerned about weakening demand as new competitors introduce cheaper AI models. Nvidia forecasts a 56% YoY revenue increase for FY 2026 and 21% for FY 2027, yet risks remain as the AI chip market becomes more competitive.

Amazon, Microsoft, and Google account for nearly half of Nvidia’s data center sales. Their investments in Nvidia’s AI chips have powered cloud AI workloads, but recent underperformance in cloud revenue is forcing them to reconsider expensive AI hardware spending. Companies are increasingly looking for alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, such as in-house chips and more affordable AI models. AI training, which once required millions of dollars in Nvidia GPUs, can now be done for as little as $50 using new techniques. Alibaba’s latest AI model has surpassed DeepSeek, challenging Nvidia’s dominance. With cloud growth slowing, hyperscalers are cutting back, further threatening Nvidia’s future revenue.

Competition in the AI hardware space is intensifying as more companies shift away from Nvidia’s expensive GPUs. DeepSeek’s R1 model is now available on AWS and Azure, gaining rapid adoption due to its low cost. Alibaba’s Qwen2.5-Max is reportedly more advanced, further pressuring Nvidia. Research from Stanford and the University of Washington has demonstrated that powerful AI models can be trained for just $50, proving that high-end GPUs are no longer necessary. Major tech firms like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are investing in custom AI chips, reducing reliance on Nvidia and reshaping the market.

AMD is rapidly expanding its AI chip business, positioning itself as a strong competitor. CEO Lisa Su expects tens of billions in AI chip revenue annually, and the company is accelerating the launch of its Instinct MI350 to compete with Nvidia’s flagship chips. Other companies, including OpenAI, Google, and Amazon, are developing their own AI chips to reduce dependency on Nvidia. These alternatives are proving to be more efficient and cost-effective, which could threaten Nvidia’s ability to maintain its premium pricing and dominant market position.

Wall Street remains skeptical about Nvidia’s valuation. The stock is trading at 12.5x forward revenue for FY 2027, with a high forward P/E ratio of 25x FY 2026 EPS estimates. Comparatively, Alphabet trades at 18.5x forward P/E, making Nvidia look significantly more expensive. With Amazon, Google, and Microsoft seeing weaker cloud revenue growth, Wall Street is pushing them to cut capital expenditures. If hyperscalers reduce AI chip purchases, Nvidia’s revenue projections may be revised downward, increasing concerns about the sustainability of its high valuation.

The future of Nvidia’s stock price remains uncertain. A prolonged correction could continue as the AI market undergoes structural changes. The company faces mounting competition from AMD, DeepSeek, and custom AI chips, which could erode its market share. If hyperscalers continue to scale back on AI hardware spending, Nvidia’s revenue growth could take a hit. Stock valuation comparisons highlight potential downside risks, with Nvidia trading at 12.3x forward revenue for FY 2027. Forecasts for Nvidia’s revenue range from $179 billion to $334 billion, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the company’s growth potential. While Nvidia remains a dominant force, the increasing number of competitors and shifting industry trends suggest that its upside may be limited.

Financial data reinforces Nvidia’s strong market presence, with a 78% YoY revenue growth in Q4, reaching $39.3 billion, driven by a 93% increase in data center revenue. Analysts estimate Nvidia’s forward revenue between $179 billion and $334 billion, reflecting its market strength. However, Nvidia’s high forward P/E ratio of 40–50x, compared to Alphabet’s 20–25x, indicates stretched valuations that may not be sustainable. Despite its leadership in AI chips, the emergence of alternatives is forcing Nvidia to adapt or risk losing ground.

Broader industry trends indicate a shift in AI and semiconductor investments. Hyperscalers are prioritizing efficiency over Nvidia’s expensive GPUs, turning to cost-effective AI models from DeepSeek, Alibaba, and academic institutions. Geopolitical factors may also impact Nvidia’s supply chain and stock price. Market performance suggests a shift in investor sentiment, with Microsoft’s stock down 20% from its peak despite the S&P 500 rising 10%. The AI sector is evolving, and Nvidia’s dominance, built on CUDA, faces growing competition from rising alternatives.

**TL;DR:** Nvidia’s stock has struggled since peaking in June 2024 due to rising competition from DeepSeek and AMD, reduced cloud investments, and concerns over high valuation. Despite strong earnings, Wall Street remains skeptical about its long-term growth. AI hardware spending is shifting towards cost-effective solutions, putting pressure on Nvidia’s pricing power. While the company remains dominant, increasing competition and hyperscaler cutbacks could limit its upside potential.

The 200-day MA has historically been a rather important indicator, often signaling further price drops. Many backtests have shown it wise to move to cash whenever the market drops below the 200-day MA, and reenter once it recovers.

At the same time, we have all heard the ""never sell / just keep buying more"" mentality. ""Set it and forget it"". ""Time in the market beats timing the market"", and so on.

I think one less talked about reason to hold at least some bond in your retirement portfolio is to be able to buy the dip in times like this when you *have a long time horizon of 15+ years*.

Yes there is uncertainly in the short term but chance is also high that market will recover in the next year. If it does not, well you will sell bond to buy stock as part of your annual/semi-annual rebalance anyway.

Is this market timing? Oh yes. But is also a bit of common sense to buy the dip. BTW I will not risk my emergency fund or play with it in taxable accounts.

What do you think?

1j5mfss,European stimulus should benefit European financial services,"The tensions with the United States and the sentiment that it is no longer a reliable defense or trading partner have led to a few highly visible results:

* defense stocks have gone vertical
* Germany has effectively abandoned its spending limits
* European unity is at an all-time high
* a desire for European sovereignty is increasing

In the past I placed bets on the defense sector, and while those will likely continue to pay off I have been exploring other sectors where Europe has been reliant on the Americans. This includes:

* cloud computing platforms
* software services
* financial services
* medical technologies

FinTech jumps out not just for sovereignty reasons but also for the simple fact that all of this additional spending (trillions over the next decade) will need to be processed by someone, and that someone is preferably going to be European. For now I have made a small bet on the sector as a whole (ETF is [ESIF](https://www.ishares.com/de/privatanleger/de/produkte/315815/ishares-msci-europe-financials-sector-ucits-etf) in Europe, [EUFN](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239645/) in USA) and am starting to dig into both the individual components and emerging FinTech companies. A shocking number of the firms in the index have seen close to 100% gains over the last year, so the question to answer is how much more revenue they can realize with the shift in spending from the USA and the increase in domestic spending.

As a black swan event, it is not inconceivable that the European Commission could ban MasterCard and Visa, using a mix of anticompetitive practices and European sovereignty as a justification [[1]](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/api/files/document/print/en/ip_19_2311/IP_19_2311_EN.pdf).

1j5bkyq,IRA hedge against forex slide?,"Hi folks, 

I have a Roth IRA which I probably need to early access over the next year or two. At the same time, I will be moving to the UK soon and needing my wealth in GBP. 

I am seriously concerned about a major exchange rate slide, impacting the value I can take out of the account in the future. I’m considering liquidating it, eating the tax and penalty hit, and converting to GBP immediately, as a hedge for my future. This comes with obviously huge drawbacks. 

I realized perhaps I can instead move my Roth investments to a fund that somehow mirrors the USD/GBP rate, so that if the exchange does slide as I fear, my fund would gain USD value. I bank with Schwab and am not sure if I could just directly invest in GBP in a Roth there. I’m not clear what, if any, funds might offer the above performance. 

Anyone have any suggestions? This is money that my family anticipates needing to tap despite the early withdrawal issues. Taking the hit now is preferable to also taking a hit later but getting way less GBP for it.

If not, what is the safe/optimal withdrawal rate?","My mother passed away and I inherited a trust worth about $500,000. The rules are set up to where I can withdraw up to 5% of the initial principal amount per year until I turn 35 (in 7 years) in which I will unlock the full value of the trust. I am debating on how much to withdraw, between 0-5%. I want to know much I can withdraw to continue growth in the account while deploying the money elsewhere. 

Background: 28, married, first kid on the way (we want more), financially stable with no real financial stress. I have a good job that I don't mind, my wife and I already run a small business on the side, we have one rental home (our first primary residence) and live in a long-term (forever?) home. Our mortgage is 6.8%, no other debt. No interest in starting a business, but am considering grabbing another rental property. 

I am setting up a meeting with the portfolio manager of the trust later this month, and will discuss withdrawal rates with them. I want to keep the fund ""aggressively"" invested with them, which seems to roughly compare to the Bogleheads 3-fund portfolio. I am really torn on how much to withdraw each year. 

With this new inheritance I plan to shrink my current monthly savings to enjoy life a little more. More trips, more hobby spending, etc. 

If I withdraw 5% each year, I will have the new ability to max out my Roth IRA and HSA accounts each year, and possibly my 401k as well. I could also forego maxing out my 401k and make additional principal payments on my 6.8% mortgage. Or, I could simply take out, say 2% annually, and just focus on putting that into the Roth and HSA.

1j4wcl3,TopBuild: Q4/Fiscal 2024 Results: Challenges Amidst Growth,"TopBuild is maintained with a HOLD rating, as we lower its price target amid macroeconomic challenges, particularly in the residential housing sector. Despite low growth expectations, the company continues aggressive acquisitions and capital allocation strategies. Its resilient business model and strong cash flow support potential long-term growth, though short-term sales declines are anticipated.

Investment Thesis:

In our first TopBuild report in December, we started our coverage with a HOLD rating. Our original price target was $401. After the conclusion of Q4 and fiscal 2024 results, we maintain our rating. Nonetheless, we have reduced our price target by 3.3% to $388 instead. After receiving updated management guidance, we believe the current macroeconomic environment continues to be a major headwind. There is much uncertainty about the residential housing market. Growth is expected at low single-digits or negative year-over-year. This is despite management maintaining a strong acquisition strategy.

# Key Drivers

* **Acquisition Strategy:** TopBuild has a strong history of acquiring smaller insulation and building material firms. In fiscal 2024 alone, they acquired a total of 8 companies between installation and specialty distribution. In total, the companies annual sales totaled $153.1 million in annual sales. Most recently, on February 3, 2025, TopBuild acquired Seal-Rite. Seal-Rite is a provider of fiberglass and spray foam insulation for residential and commercial markets in Omaha and Lincoln. With the acquisition set to close in Q2, Seal-Rite Insulation generated annual sales of $15 million.
* **Resilient Business Model & Pricing Power:** Despite an uncertain residential and construction environment, TopBuild has shown resilience. Unlike say bathroom renovations or flooring upgrades, insulation is a necessity for residential and commercial projects. Additionally, serving both the residential and commercial markets helps to mitigate risks linked to slowdowns in any one segment. If new home construction declines or worsens, 35% of 2024 sales were still in commercial/industrial construction. The insulation industry as a whole remains highly fragmented with many local and regional players competing at smaller scales. TopBuild has capitalized on its scale to unify growing market share via strategic acquisitions. TopBuild is unique because it has a vertically integrated business model. It combines installation services (TruTeam) and distribution (Service Partners) under one corporate umbrella.
* **Cash Flow Generation:** A major aspect of TopBuild's investment appeal is due to their effective capital allocation. The company has demonstrated a willingness to use strong cash flow generation to fund their M&A service offering. Aside from acquisitions, TopBuild is known to repurchase their outstanding stock. In their Q4 and year-end results, management announced a new authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion worth of shares. This new authorization is adds to the $188.1 million remaining from the prior announcement as of December 31, 2024. While free cash flow did decline by 10%, the company still reported strong results with total generation of $706.7 million.

*Conclusion*

TopBuild's near-term growth is in a peculiar environment as costs stay elevated and labor shortages continue. The 2025 outlook provided by management indicated sales between $5.05 billion and $5.35 billion. The most-likely scenario is that sales will decline year-over-year. This would be the first time since becoming a public company a decade ago in 2015. M&A continue to be a priority moving ahead with one already planned to be completed in Q2. Acquisitions have proven to be a strategic growth aim with 8 taking place in 2024 contributing $153.1 in annual sales. With their strong free cash flow generation, TopBuild continues to repurchase a significant amount of shares with their newly announced $1 billion program.

Despite short-term concerns, TopBuild is well-positioned for long-term growth due to structural housing supply constraints. There is a strong reliance on an uncertain residential housing market. Still, management expects low-single digit growth in commercial/industrial sales. These sales account for a growing $1.88 billion in sales (43.9% total).

# Risk Factors:

* **Residential Construction Sensitivity:** With 61.7% of sales coming from the residential market, a downturn can significantly reduce insulation demand. Management already expects a mid-single digit decline in fiscal 2025 which is set to hinder overall sales growth. Although TopBuild has diversified into commercial/industrial insulation, the residential market is heavily relied upon to continue growing. One of the primary drivers of housing market cyclicality is the cost of borrowing. Mortgage rates stay elevated with a 30-year fixed rate mortgage hovering around 6.7%. While rates have fluctuated, the high cost of financing a home persists. This has led to lower housing demand. As a result, existing home sales have declined.
* **Raw Material & Supply Chain Risks:** There is significant dependence on raw material availability. Cost fluctuations in insulation materials, particularly fiberglass and spray foam, pose concerns. If raw material costs increase and TopBuild can't pass them on to customers, profit margins will be squeezed. In recent years, logistics bottlenecks and material shortages have affected the insulation industry leading to higher costs and delayed projects. Both of which hurt overall sales.

1j4vz97,"If S&P 500 earnings keep growing but the market stays flat, when will the P/E ratio return to normal?","Let’s say the stock market continues going sideways for a while, but earnings of S&P 500 companies keep growing at their usual pace. When would the P/E ratio drop back to its historical average?

Right now, the S&P 500 P/E ratio is around 22–24, while the long-term average is 16–17. If earnings grow at 6–8% per year (which is historically normal), it would take 5–7 years for the P/E ratio to fall back to historical levels—assuming stock prices don’t move.

Basically, if we’re in a sideways market but earnings keep climbing, valuations will gradually normalize by the end of the decade. So even if prices don’t rise, long-term investors still “benefit” from earnings growth bringing fundamentals back in line.

Is this correct? What do you think? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j4vz97/if_sp_500_earnings_keep_growing_but_the_market/,1741269332.0
1j4vwu2,How high is too high? Perspective on valuation,"With S&P 500 P/E at 28.95, its common to hear that the market is over valued. This is easily concluded by looking at the current PE ratio and comparing that to historical averages.

Let's briefly look at what this means from a return on your invested capital.

* P/E at 28.95 translates to a TTM yield of \~3.5%
* Next you need to account for earnings growth in the future. Let's assume earnings grow in line with GDP growth
* Average annual real GDP growth has been 2.5% on top of healthy inflation of 2%
* Thus, your expected annual return will be \~8% (2.5+2+3.5). This assumes that the long term GDP growth and inflation are in line with historical averages.
* Now the historical annual return of the S&P 500 is \~10%. Based on current valuations, in order to achieve the historical average annual return over a long period of time, nominal GDP (real growth or inflation) would need to increase 2% greater than historical averages. 
* Alternatively, valuations would need to continue increasing consistently and sustainably which is highly unlikely, OR long term future annual returns of the S&P 500 will be less than historical returns

None of these things has ever happened sustainably over a long period of time, even through technology and industrial revolutions, which is why an overvalued market has real consequences in terms of expected returns, and why imo folks like Buffet are hoarding cash.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j4vwu2/how_high_is_too_high_perspective_on_valuation/,1741269133.0

1j4v8os,SESG.PA: A place to ride out the storm and prosper perhaps?,"Given the seismic changes taking place in geopolitics currently, with the ground seemingly shifting on a daily basis, there is great uncertainty about the future in general, especially so with the stock markets. What seems certain right now however is a need for increasing national self-reliance in areas that are critical to defence, commerce and manufacturing. With that in mind I have decided to make a notable investment.

When considering where to invest, in my opinion the United States is a far less appealing place to invest now than only one month ago for various reasons. Not only is there considerable political volatility and a worrying descent seemingly towards a divided, bellicose autocratic nation, apparently aligning with formerly hostile states such as Russia at the expense of long standing allies, but there is also a growing backlash to the conduct being witnessed, from within and without the United States.

This backlash includes, boycotting American companies, particularly those whose leaders have ‘kissed the ring’ and may now be supplicants, at the whim of the new administration. I expect the early impact of this boycott to be visible in the next reporting season which is only about two months away. With 41%¹ of revenues generated outside of the United States for companies within the S&P500, according to Citi Global Wealth Investments, I expect the boycott may cause various companies to miss expectations, perhaps notably.

With that in mind I have looked closer to home for my next Double Bubbler investment and in an area central to defence, commerce and manufacturing. One industry that underpins these areas, and may gain from an international shift away from American manufacturers and suppliers, is that of satellite communications. So much of our modern society from trade to warfare relies on this essential technology and I expect the European Union and Britain to support their own regional champions.

Companies such as [SES A.S](http://ses.com/). who provide a range of satellite communication services around the world, with a particularly strong presence in Europe, including being the lead partner for a consortium who will be designing, delivering and operating the next generation IRIS2² MEO-LEO network part funded by the European Union. In short this will be a secure network for European governments, where SES retains the opportunity to commercialise ‘over 90% of the MEO capacity and part of the LEO capacity’.

In time I will write an article on why I bought 100,000 shares in SES this morning, however in brief it is their expertise, current global communications service offering as well as the potential of significant future business, a large proportion of which is already under contract. What I also particularly like about SES is that it is currently paying approximately 10% in dividends and is intent on increasing the dividend further ‘once SES meets its net leverage target of below 3x within 12-18 months’³.

While the future is uncertain, the dividend and apparent prospects for SES, give me confidence this may be a good place to weather the storm and even prosper perhaps. Hopefully with potential share price growth together with compounding dividend reinvestments I will double my money before too long!

1j4ugrs,Stagflation & Fed rates  in regard to tariff and inflation.,"I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around this.

Tariffs are inflationary—they raise the cost of goods and services and can prevent potential Fed rate cuts.

However, increased costs of goods and services can reduce demand, leading to economic contraction, which is deflationary.

Corporate tax cuts are inflationary, while reduced government spending is deflationary.

It’s been a while since I studied macroeconomics.

Are we heading toward stagflation? What are your thoughts?
How does the Fed adjust rates in a stagflationary environment?

Taking it a step further—what is DJT trying to achieve with the trade war? (Edit, is he trying to recoup tax money from tariff?)

PS I’d like to add that DJT follows what Ray Dalio preaches to take control of US debt. He advised to keep it under 3% and do it faster the better due to bond rates which I don’t quite understand.

Meanwhile, some VCs are also leaning into this PE-style acquisition trend, even taking control of listed companies. But here’s the catch: these industries have long been ignored for their low margins and lack of scalability, some investors believe “bad business models” with little differentiation.

1j4b2bx,How to remove exposure to an index component,"We seem to be getting a lot of the same question recently about how to remove exposure of an index component if someone holds an index fund. 

Whether it's NVDIA because you think there's an AI bust coming. Or you don't want to own TSLA because of Musk - there are ways to remove exposure of a component in an index. 

First - the easiest way to do that is to not hold that fund and find a different fund that fits your criteria.

But if you want to hold certain types of indices such as large cap indices but you want to exclude a large cap component - it is a bit more difficult.  

These are the different ways from most complicated to simplest.

1. Roll synthetic short futures with equivalent negative delta. 
2. Write equivalent negative delta using deep otm call credit spreads or naked calls.
3. Short the equivalent dollar amount of shares
4. Roll long short puts or put debit spreads.
5. Use a model-based replication service (usually only avail through an SMA/UMA program) which supports trade restrictions. 
6. If an inverse ETP exists, buy the dollar equivalent of the inverse ETP. 
7. Use a direct index solution which supports rebalancing. 

Some of these solutions require more trading effort and derivatives experience than the average investor. So unless you are familiar - don't do it. And it's not possible to use some of these techniques in retirement accounts.

Simplest for most people is probably #7. 

There are probably more ways - but these are the techniques of top of mind. And if anyone cares - I normally use technique #2. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j4b2bx/how_to_remove_exposure_to_an_index_component/,1741201718.0

My wife and I are looking for some advice, so thank you in advance for any assistance.

We live in a HCOL area. We make decent money, me $130k, her $160k, and are both 35. We have $90k combined in our 401k, another $50k between a ROTH and a T-IRA. We will max out both our 401ks this year. We also have about $225k in a HYSA.

Neither one of us wants to have a long commute, as we have a 4 month old daughter (We have started and are funding a 529 for her), and this means that we really can't afford a home or even condo in our area, we would have a mortgage of at least $7k a month after putting down the full $200k. Really to save money on housing we would have a 1 hr commute each way. Our current rent is $3,500 + about $350 a month in utilities. Our daughter just started daycare at $2,500 a month. 

I know we are in a better position then the average American but am just unsure how to move forward right now. We have talked with grandma about retiring and watching our daughter full time to save on daycare but it seems like a lot for her (She really wants to do it), and our daughter has taken to daycare well and is pretty social. 

  
I guess our question is, what would you do with the money in the HYSA? The S&P seems terrifying right now, the interest rate in the account has dropped from a high of 5.5% down to 3.5%. Would you invest in another markets real estate, put in an index fund, start a small business? How can we take this money and use it for something if it cannot help us purchase a home.

I will add, both of our jobs are a bit up in the air, and we are near the top of what we make in our industry currently. We could be a bit house poor and get a place, but it scares us both knowing finding similar jobs could take a lot of time.

I searched all over and could not find how much I was supposed to put into the settlement account. Was it the -$11.04? I added $100 just to be safe.

Why would Digital Advisor put me in a position where I had to take any action? And how did I end up having to put unplanned money in? Shouldn't it just use the original $1000 and put it wherever it needs it?

For the most part, the Robinhood account does not had a strict strategy to it.  My general thought process was that getting in the market and waiting was probably the strategy that would empower me to build a portfolio with the the time I could. Over the past 8ish months, I have been placing recurring investments in stocks and etfs (a lot of tech) to take advantage of the DCA. I know a strategy that essentially boils down to ""just buy stocks"" isn't much but it has worked pretty well for me thus far. It would probably be fair to say that I am ""long"" I think. 

  
My fears about an upcoming recession and instability in the global market have me questioning this strategy. Even if my portfolio is long and my timeframe lasts a few decades, do I need to change my approach? Should I just keep chugging and count on a upward correction in the long term (like years to decades)? Does it make sense to keep buying (like with recurring investments) if I anticipate the stock price of something is going to drop. 

  
Very scared. I know that every investment is placed with the knowledge that I could lose it all, but this is the first time in my life that the prospect of losing so much money has been real. Any advice would be appreciated. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j3k6zq/casualuncomplicated_young_investor_looking_for/,1741118934.0
1j3jr41,Y'all Need to Calm Down and Grow a Pair,"I am regretting replying to some posts here, as now my feed is nothing but ultimate doomsaying from this sub. It's nothing but ""where to go outside US"" and ""this is gonna be awful"" and ""rebalancing isn't the same as timing"" (it is), etc. etc. etc. etc.

  
Listen, equities in particular are going to be volatile when there's an increase in uncertainty. Welcome to investing. The market is incorporating the effect of tariffs, counter-tariffs, deregulation, etc. on a number of different variables. Of course there will be debate, and that debate shows itself in the form of price volatility.

But guess what? Equities have always seen corrections, bubbles, bear markets, recessions, etc. Do you know what the ultimate, underlying lesson is for those?

1. You are not some special magic super genius that can time market tops and market bottoms.
2. As a result, the most plausible best case scenario for most people is buying and holding throughout the volatility.

Welcome to a normal market: there will be times when things are good, times when things are bad, and times where we're not sure where it's going to go. But unless you can point to a specific mechanism, with a specific catalyst, on how the stock market is going to explode, you're letting fear get the better of you.

TL;DR: Calm down, stop with the doom-posting, you're an investor for a reason, and hopefully that reason included a LONG TERM view with the acknowledgement that things will necessarily change and be difficult to determine. All the ""omg i sold out asap"" bullshit is either people complaining about the election results, or giving into fear to such an extent that they've hurt themselves.

I know from being on here and especially Reddit there are quite a few liberal investors, but I've always thought that investing and wealth building is a more capitalist/conservative thing, owing to the fact the companies you are investing in are most times massive corporate giants out for their shareholders profits. The No. 1 evil in a socialist world. Also the entire idea of wealth building kind of rests on the idea of capitalism itself and trying to get ahead of others and creating more inequality. Yet I see liberals (democrats, socialists) investing. Why?
I am a conservative and I personally think capitalism is a wonderful system for a low income person like me to get ahead one day.

1j3hp4h,Is there a benefit in spreading funds across multiple separate accounts/brokerages? [the US],"This is not a question about different account types (Roth IRA, IRA, 401k ,etc.) I am just wondering if there is a benefit in opening multiple individual (non-retirement) brokerage accounts after a certain amount of funds. For example, when it comes to saving accounts, since FDIC insurance is limited to $250k per account, I believe it makes sense in opening a new account when you hit the limit. 

What about brokerage accounts? I guess I am thinking about it from a systemic risk standpoint. Is it better to open a new account in a different brokerage after you have, for example, $250k in one account? Does it even make sense to be opening a new account in the same brokerage? Are there any protections similar to the FDIC that are limited per account?

I understand that there is more hassle in managing multiple individual brokerage accounts, like taxes and such. But are there benefits that outweigh those?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j3hp4h/is_there_a_benefit_in_spreading_funds_across/,1741112849.0

1j3gvwa,What players move the stock market the most?,"As I understand it, retail investors only account for roughly 10% of the buying and selling of stocks.  So that means the rest is done between large institutions correct?  Stocks only go up and down if someone is buying/selling. Theoretically the price of stocks would stay the same if no one bought or sold for a day?

So correct me if I'm wrong, the constant movement of the stock market is pretty much institutions speculating between on another about how they feel the price of a stock is at any given moment and trying to get micro gains throughout the day by buying and selling between one another?  And the stocks they do this with mostly comes from 401ks and rich peoples money?

For example today after the Tariff announcements, stocks went down because a number of institutions felt is was to their advantage to liquidate and move their money elsewhere.... and another buyer/institution felt is was worth the risk to buy these at a lower price, with neither of them knowing what the best play was, but both taking a gamble on their feelings/guesses/data?  And as a result the market went down overall, even though another institution bought the stocks because they felt it was a good play to still make money eventually buy buying them at a lower price.

If you've made it this far, how is this not adult Trading Cards?  These stocks hold no actual value except what the next institution, rich person, retail investor is willing to pay for them.  Most don't offer a reasonable return by holding them.  And the companys stock you bought don't get any money directly from you buying them \*yes I understand they kinda do in indirect way\*, and yes if you have the majority of stocks you can dictate what the company does in a lot of ways, but that would probably turn into a disaster since almost no here on reddit knows how to run a company.....

And yea you can make money on trading cards and fades, but what happen when a fad runs out and the rich don't want to play the stock market game with their money, if no one wants your cards any more what value or return do you have?  These stocks don't give you money because a company is doing good, its the willingness for another buyer to buy your stock/card that gives them value.....

1j3f0m4,"To Sell Or Not To Sell, Here's my 2 cents to get through the Storm.","There's been a lot of chatter on selling or not today.  
  
Here is the honest truth- if you have near term plans and need the money soon (next 12-24 months)- sell right now but only sell what you need to cover that expense. This will be different for everybody. If you're looking for your sign, this maybe it.  
  
We are in a vastly inflated market, and it may not recover for a few years. Prices have not reflected true value for some time now. There is reason to be concerned if you need to make a purchase and that money is pivotal to the purchase- now is a good time to reduce some of your assets- as the assets are mostly imaginary value.

If you can handle a 3-7 year financial storm, then don't sell. Hold everything you can.   
  
Whatever you decide, Cheers good luck folks. I made my moves in November before this storm started. :)

1j3eigb,Advice for 73 yr old who lost $200k,"My FIL started dating a much younger drug addict.  That went about as well as you would expect. He had $200k cash and its all gone. He is now $30k in consumer debt and developing signs of either Alzheimers or dementia, we don’t have diagnosis yet. 

He was living in NC and we are now moving him across the country to live near us so we can keep an eye on him. The plan for now is to have him live with us so we can assess his ability to function independently. 

He does have a fully paid house. Realtor is saying it will probably go for $300-$350k. He gets $2500/ month in social security. 

We will probably just keep the funds in a HYSA until we have a strategy. 

We could

1. Have him live with us until he requires round the clock care. Use the house funds as savings for him. 

2. If he is able to function independently for a while, he could buy a house here and live on social security. Or we could move in with him once he needs more help, then potentially sell the house when he needs more intensive care. 

3. Maybe something in between where he puts down a down payment on a house, we pay the mortgage, we all live together, and he has a savings left over. Again, could sell if he needed to recover his down payment. 

3. Something else Im unaware of. Maybe some different investment vehicle for the house funds. 

Oh and obviously the consumer debt would get paid through the sell of the house. 

Just feels weird to have that much cash sitting around. But maybe thats normal at this age.

1j3ctpy,Buy Buy Buy Buy Buy just Buy!,"Literally just buy. Buy right at the top. Buy at the bottom. Just buy!

I hope the market does crash, then it’s on discount. 

I can’t stress this enough. Just buy buy buy and cost average in over the long term. This is the nature of the investing game.

The data is right there. 

The past is very likely indicative of the future given how much probabilistic weight is behind the S&P’s data. 

Yes, anything can happen but the market has ALWAYS recovered. If it doesn’t, well then everyone now has far bigger problems. 

Be that person that buys right at the top *and* buy at the bottom. Investing is a game of cost averaging in over the long term.

*Especially* buy when the market crashes. Just buy as much S&P ETF whenever you can as much as you viable can over many years. 

What’s high now you’ll look back in the distant future and see that it was damn cheap, relatively.

Buy, cost average in, hold over many years, ignore your emotions, that’s it. That’s all you need to do.

It really doesn’t matter whether the stock market goes up or down. Outcome is positive either way from this perspective.

This was a huge mental shift for me. If it goes up you’re gaining. If it goes down you get to buy more for cheaper for it to eventually go up - so you’re eventually gaining by cost averaging in anyway.

This is the strategy and it’s a win-win strategy. 

Buy at the top and buy at the bottom it doesn’t matter. Keep banging money in to the S&P engine and let compounding do its thing. 

This is the long term investing game. Ignore all the noise and just buy and hold the S&P or an All World fund and you’ll very likely be just fine in many years to come.

This ChatGPT4.5 moment marks the end of the era of AI scaling purely from pre-training compute and therefore cast doubt on the entire projected trajectory of AI making massive leaps in increasing intelligence and there for real meaningful applications with AI, which Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also mentioned which was that AI currently has no real meaningful applications.

Based on this, I think this raises a fundamental concern on the sustainability of the AI growth trend and brings out a potential of a much broader weakening for the AI related companies and tech sector.

1. S&P. DOW and NASDAQ are all down over the past week and down for YTD

2. Tariffs are in today 

3. Fear surrounding tech earnings starting to slow

How long could this last for? Trump is so unpredictable it seems everyone wants their money out of the market. US companies objectively are making money, particularly MAG7, so how long is this sell off going to last and when will things start to recover? 

My fear is that this will last all year, money will be tied up and the US economy will be dragged into a depression caused by Trump dismantling the federal government, tariffs and Trump lap dogging for Russia.

1j34nnd,"So we bet on coal, or natural gas?","I assume everyone gets the script today: U.S. is going to increase tariff until manufacturing returns to the U.S. If necessary, there will be more rounds of tariffs. If that leads to recession, great! Both the inflation problem and the U.S. national debt interest problem will go away.

To support manufacturing, steelmaking and aluminum are must haves. Both are energy hogs and require dramatic development of electricity generations. Renewable energy is sometimes cheaper, but they are intermittent energies. Developing nuclear energy is not a near-term solution, so that leaves us natural gas and coal. Do we see any near-term catalyst for coal and natural gas?

Or we go directly to X and AA? Their IV is pretty high though: 45% to 50% for June 20 calls. I can see 100% tariff for both categories.

1j33f8h,What should I do with TLT/ZROZ,"As everyone might have known, Atlanta Fed model projects the Q1 GDP growth as about -3%, market crashed, and CPI data is coming in on March 12th with the fed interest rate decision coming in a week after that. Both indicators suggest that consumption is down at the time being and inflation could see moderate declines. While I'm not an expert on the domestic and international demand of the dollar bond in the future, which seems to face some challenges, I do believe the inflation/growth expectation is the huge factor for 20-year treasury pricing at least for the short term. And with such a significant decrease of the GDP growth from the previous number, I'm not sure even a unchanged 3% CPI print could undermine TLT/ZROZ a lot.

I'm not sure the sentiment about long-term treasury is in this sub but I've been itching to make a move since the end of last year, when the yields are going over the roof to above 5%. I think the pricing back then was compounded with a lot of uncertainty brought by administration changes. I didn't buy long-term and watched the yield to go from 5% all the way to \~4.5% in the span of just 1 quarter. A lot of the intial fear of the uncertainties have been subdued. For now, the tariffs' impact is still not showing and I got this feeling that it will be a slowburn which could not change the course of the inflation. It will take us nowhere near the 2022 post-covid turnmoils.

For now, most of my portfolio is sitting in SGOV, with monthly coupons compouding to roughly 4+%. This is getting lower than last year. TLT's coupons are accumulating to a similar yearly gain. I usually have a habit of investing a several thousands into SPY/QQQ/SCHD per month but now I'll stop those payments and consider redirecting them to 20y treausry ETF. I'm deliberating on several options (1) put $30000 (roughly 30% of my total asset) in TLT to catch the potential gain in the upcoming CPI/FOMC announcement. (2) put $15000 in now and decide whether to increase the stake after the FOMC week. (3) just stop investing in SPY/QQQ/SCHD and stick with SGOV. Under the scenario where I decide to buy TLT, I'll probably dump it once the forecasts are back up or I reach a certain stop gain/loss point.

Twice now basically the same freakiest has happened.   Some girl I don't know comes out of nowhere and starts talking to me online. Nothing weird or sexual.   One started on Facebook and was friends with a legit person I used to know. Both girls moved the convo to WhatsApp.   They talk for awhile about whatever.   It's actually a little annoying but I have time so I'm like whatever.   They both don't live near me at all.  

Here's the thing.  Both times they start talking about investing in crypto.   I have investments and am not bad there but nothing stellar just to set the record straight.   Then they want to teach me how to trade in crypto.  The first one pointed me to a free web based tool where you can play with fake money.  I now forget how that one ended but I stopped it somehow.   This last one wanted me to use a downloaded app.  I refused.   She then kind of threw a rod.  I definitely backed out.  She threw a bigger rod.  I blocked and reported her.

Is this a thing?  What the heck kind of game or scam was that?  The first one said bigger money to get in was needed - to get good rewards.  The second said i could start small but to start.

1j2u4ji,GDP Forecast so bad the Administration wants to make up different numbers,"Seriously, I can't believe how fast and how far we're going off the rails.  6 weeks ago, Atlanta Fed had a Q1 GDP growth forecast of 2.9%, last week it was revised down to a decline of 1.5%.  Apparently, that wasn't low enough as it's now been revised down to 2.8% decline.

6 weeks to swing from 2.9% growth to 2.8% contraction.  That's a crazy level of slow down in the economy under this Administration in such little time.

It's such a bad economic forecast that the Commerce Department is wanting to hide the number by changing the way GDP is calculated. That's like North Korea or Russia just making up economic numbers. What in the world is happening here??

The US is losing its stability and integrity.  Capital will be allocated away from the USA if they go through with this.

1j2ptvi,Shouldn’t Graham’s suggested 50/50 stocks to bonds portfolio generate most wealth over time?,"I read the Intelligent Investor and from the myriad of gems in there, the key point I took home for the defensive investor was to use a 50/50 stocks to bonds portfolio and keep balancing the weights as and when they go out of proportion.

I kept thinking about this and was wondering, shouldn’t this strategy generate the most wealth over time?

Assume one bought VT and BNDW with a 50/50 weight and keeps adding to them every month. Whenever VT increases, you sell and add to BNDW, increasing your cash wealth. Conversely, you sell BNDW and buy VT when VT goes down, using your cash wealth to take a position in equities. Basically, you’re buying low and selling high. Over time, shouldn’t this automatic rebalance add up to significant sum compared to let’s say just having a 100% VT portfolio? Assume you only sell VT long term tax lots to avoid short term capital gains taxes.

Am I missing something? Why would a 100% VT portfolio outperform a 50/50 VT/BNDW portfolio over the long term. With the latter approach, you’re taking profits and building wealth so that you can buy equities when they’re undervalued.

1j2ox79,Real estate ownership in retirement/investment portfolio,"I developed my views around asset allocation through years working with pension funds.  

A typical pension fund will allocate up to 10% of assets to real estate - direct ownership of properties or owning a fund that owns properties.  I've replicated this approach by allocating five percent of my liquid assets in a real estate fund through my 401k.  However, I've started to wonder if this still makes sense, as an individual.

I own my home with a paid-off mortgage.  It represents about 30% of my net worth, so I have real estate exposure.   I own US stock index funds.  About 3% of the S&P 500 is invested in real estate through REITs.

One reason I wanted to do that is because Fidelity (to my layman understanding) offers better choices and options for investing in foreign markets/bonds. I've been curious about it for a while, and now seems a good time to do it.

From an american perspective, what sorts of things should I keep in mind in terms of taxes? Recommendation for resources to read and educate myself further?

Additionally, one of my preferred investment methods is to refer to etf portfolios for a collection of 'safe' positions to research deeper. For instance, I'd reference just the fact of which stocks make up VOO but find the positions I'd actually like to invest in. But use the makeup of VOO to start with. I don't have a specific thing against buying etfs, but...I don't know, instinctively they feel odd, I don't like not 'owning' my positions.

1j2m50f,Is selling ever OK to rebalanced portfolio (as opposed to rebalancing by buying)?,"I started investing around 5 years ago, and have been consistently DCAing into mainly VTI (US) and VXUS (International) with a weekly breakdown of 70% and 30% respectively. I wasn't really up-to-date on rebalancing until recently, when I noticed that the performance of VTI over the years has taken me pretty far off of my target.

I would like to rebalnacne to bring VTI and VXUS back to 70% and 30%, and looking to actually bring VXUS closer to 35% like the Vamguard target date funds. However, even if I DCA only into VXUS it will take over a year to reach this target while buying thousands of dollars worth per month.

I'm wondering whether I should sell a portion of VTI to instantly rebalance? This wouldn't be something I do all of the time, only yearly. I'm aware that there are tax implications, but honestly, the more my portfolio grows, the harder and more unrealistic rebalancing by buying becomes? I'm thinking that at some point rebalancing by selling becomes the only way?

Does that make sense? Or am I thinking about this wrong? I'm definitely invested for the long term, and don't imagine pulling anything until retirement, so not sure how to balance the need to rebalance with taxes...

But now I’m checking it out again and it seems pretty damn solid for where it’s currently at. Am I missing something? Nearly all metrics seem very strong fundamentally. But I’m curious as to what the bear case is? What’s hindering the company so much? 

Because as I look at the company, it’s roughly 70B in overall valuation. Revenue continues to keep going up each year. (About 12% average over the last 3 years. Which is respectable.) They’re planning to buy an awful lot of shares back. (Based on what I’ve read $15-$20B worth over the coming years.) about $5B (give or take 1B or so.) back last year alone. The company is generating good cash flows of about $4-6B a year. If you throw the buy backs on top that’s some serious value back. 

To me, looking at the cash flow and revenue trend, the balance sheet, cash on hand, the massive buybacks, and everything else in between else just seems like a screaming buy. I don’t see many companies out there with this kind of presumptive value discrepancy. What are your thoughts? I’m personally seriously considering opening a position again for the long term.

I bought in way early to crypto and could sell about 25% of my portfolio to pay for the solar panels. That’s at today’s prices. If we get a nice bull run, that % goes down. So I view this a diversifying my investments i guess. But I really value the crypto and solar is still slightly new to me. Contractors all tell me the system will pay for itself in 5-6 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j1uvdg/would_you_sell_crypto_to_pay_cash_for_solar/,1740933248.0
1j1u4or,How should I proceed with Roth IRA?,"In sales so combination of salary and commission. Won’t know what I make until year end. It will probably be under income limits for Roth IRA, but very close and not sure. 

How do I approach

1. Skip out on Roth 

2. Contribute to it? 

3. Contribute to taxable. At year end if I can fund a Roth IRA sell 7k from taxable and put in Roth. 

4. Option I’m not thinking of?

1j1trz6,Back testing- Is this too good to be true?,"So I run a back test on something I've been working in and it's results are pretty cool.

If we look at any tech company that made a move into the top 20 stocks by market cap in the S&P 500 since 1990 (when I started my back test) which wasn't already in the top 20 and put just £1000 on each one as soon as it was introduced these are the following stocks you would purchase aswell as the year of purchase and the rough price at the start of the year.

MSFT - 1991 @ $1.08
INTEL - 1992 @ $1.64
CISCO - 1996 @ $4.21
QUALCOMM - 1999 @ $4.20
ORACLE - 1999 @ $7.85
APPLE - 2007 @ $3.05
NVIDIA - 2020 @ $6.11
BROADCOM - 2021 @ $44.56

The results are roughly 4350% Since 1990 to 2025. 

On average that is a return of 120% (ish) per year. 

You put $1,000 in each one, only once in the January of that year, that's around $350,000 return. 

$8,000 to $350,000 is wild returns even if it is over 35 years.

1j1rt79,Which companies/funds will be hit hard in next major market downturn?,"So in every major market downturn a lot of companies are brought down even those that may not be expected. 

For example in the Dot com bubble in addition to tech stocks you had the collapse of Enron and MCI Worldcom. 

In 2008 in addition to bank stocks you had insurance such as AIG, big three automakers, General Electric etc.

2020 you had a lot of retailers that had been struggling for years file for bankruptcy.

Here are my predictions of who/what will be impacted:

*  Crypto - Too many meme coins and speculation. There will be a massive correction due soon not sure if as severe as 2022 but its coming
* Office Space REITS- some of these have recovered but I don't see their finances improving anytime soon as return to office has been very gradual. Also recent federal cuts will hurt demand especially in suburban office space markets.
* Meme Stocks in particular Tesla and Game stop. Telsa's PE ratio is way too high and Musk's recent antics have hurt future sales prospects. Gamestop also has way too high of a PE ratio. In a downturn people will turn away and its price will collapse
* Broadcast /Cable companies - These companies are struggling with cord cutting. In a downturn this will be first thing many consumers cut. Comcast is very vulnerable. Also any regional sports stocks such as MSGE will get hit. 
* Almost every remaining regional retailer that is publicly traded. I'm not sure how many of these are honestly left but any non national retailer that does not have a decent web presence will have a decent chance of not surviving next downturn. 
* AI related stocks. Companies have been spending hundreds of billions for their AI buildout. There will be cuts to AI budgets that not only impact NVDA and AI oriented stocks, but any REITs that own data centers, power companies doing build outs 
* Oil and Gas companies. US production has increase significantly even after blip during pandemic. Due to higher drilling costs in the US expect any dip in oil price to wipe out a lot of producers especially if they are too leveraged in debt.

Whether through good business strategy or the Trump administration helping his friend Elon (Tax rebates etc).

Even if no bullet is fired or missile is launched, economic ties and cooperation breaks down. Tariffs, loss of trade, loss of revenues, negative earnings growth. 

All while the CAPE is at nosebleed levels priced to perfection.  

Trump is miscalculating. While the US has leverage over one or several countries it will be severely hurt if the entire world unites against it.

1j1a05u,Factors influencing gold bullion and efts?,"Hey everyone,

I'm going to preface this by saying that I'm asking this question largely in the spirit of understanding the forces involved in the gold markets, and deepening my understanding of precious metals as an asset class beyond ""an insurance policy against volitility.""

But I've searched for answers in enough investing subs to know that some of you have strong opinions on gold, and you'll share them regardless of the question asked :p I'll add a comment with my specifc position in the comments so you guys have something to work with. 

**The Actual Question(s)**

The bits of information I've run into suggest gold might be a bit more complicated than I thought. The only basic assumption I'm working on at the moment is ""no matter how absurd something gets, it will probably get more insane soon."" I haven't been wrong in this assumption yet.

1) EFTs vs Gold: I'm aware of the liquidity difference, and that EFTs can become partially detached from the spot price. I also know some EFTs are backed by bullion, and offer to convert to bullion if desired. Some are backed by miners and various mints - for these last two, what are the risks/rewards of bullion vs efts? Can these efts still decouple from the spot price? Under what conditions would that happen? This is complicated by most EFTs have amortisation built into their conversions.

2) I just learned of the gold futures market, and more importantly that it might have poor structural integrity. My research shows that the situation got flagged a few years ago, but I haven't found much follow-up info from reputable sources. Did this end up getting resolved, or is it still a house of cards? If it came tumbling, will it take the spot price with it?

3) More recently, there's been a revival of the speculation on the holdings of  Fort Knox. My assumption is that if it's found to be empty, this would mean less gold in the world than thought and the price would rise in response. It seems like I have that wrong though? I'm not American so I'm not sure what the interaction is between Fort Knox and everything else.

4) Depending on your attitude towards the absurdity of the universe, and whether the powers that be are accelerationists, there is a non-zero chance the US might try to return to the gold standard. Is this economic suicide? Yes. But let's pretend it happens - I would assume this shoots the value through the roof. But I feel like I'm missing something or that it's not that straight forward. Does anyone have thoughts?

5) any other factors I should be aware of?

1j14ys8,"Maximizing Tax Benefits: Using Carryover Losses to Offset Gains (T-Bills, RSUs, Shares)","**\[Looking for Advice\]**

I made some mistakes in options trading in 2020, which resulted in a short-term loss of about $130K. I learned from my mistakes, and fortunately, I was able to secure a well-paying job in 2021. Since then, I have saved up about $300K.

I now focus on long-term investments by buying and holding shares (VOO, VTI, SCHD, top tech companies, etc.). However, I have not invested the $300K in stocks because I plan to buy a house within the next couple of years and need that money for a down payment, potential renovations, and settling in. To ensure safe and guaranteed returns, and to avoid state tax on the gains, I have been investing that money in T-Bills. Last year, I earned about $15K in interest (received a 1099-INT) from T-Bills.

While talking to a friend, I learned that if I sell T-Bills before their maturity, the gains will not be classified as interest income (1099-INT) but rather as capital gains, which can be offset against my past losses. For example, if my T-Bill matures on 6/30/2025, but I sell it on 6/25/2025 (before maturity), the gain would be treated as a capital gain rather than interest income.

Since filing my 2021 taxes, I have been deducting $3K per year from my past losses, as allowed by the IRS, and I still have $115K in carryover losses.

Additionally, I have not sold any of the vested shares I received over the past two years, and they have gained approximately 15% (\~$25K).

# My Questions:

1. Would selling T-Bills before maturity be a good strategy to offset my carryover losses?
2. When I sell my vested RSUs (which may have both long-term and short-term gains), or the shares, will I be able to offset the gains with my remaining carryover losses?
3. What other strategies can I explore to make the most of my remaining losses?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j14ys8/maximizing_tax_benefits_using_carryover_losses_to/,1740850666.0

1j0xiga,The Future of the NASDAQ 100: Room for Global Tech Companies?,"
Hey everyone,
I've been thinking about the future of the NASDAQ 100 and the possibility that, in an increasingly globalized world, American tech companies might be surpassed by those from other countries, like Israel or China.
If we see a shift in tech leadership in the future, with non-American companies dominating innovation, do you think the NASDAQ 100 could open its doors to these new players?
Here's what I'm wondering:
Necessary Changes:
Would the NASDAQ 100's inclusion criteria, currently focused mainly on American companies, need to be modified?
What would be the pros and cons of a more international NASDAQ 100?
I'm curious to hear your thoughts and spark a discussion on this topic.

1j0wfrh,Are you using 200dMA (or any other Moving Average)?,"Hey everyone,I've been experimenting with different technical indicators for my investment strategy lately, and I keep coming back to the 200-day moving average as a surprisingly reliable indicator for long-term trends.I built a simple web tool for myself to visualize stock prices relative to their 200DMA (and other timeframes) because I got tired of the clunky interfaces on most financial sites. It's been super helpful for my decision-making process - seeing that percentage distance from the MA really puts things in perspective. Do any of you use moving averages in your investing approach? 

If so:

1. Which timeframes do you find most useful? (50-day, 200-day, something else?)

1. Do you use crossovers, or just the relative position to the MA?

1. Have you found it actually improves your returns?

I'm curious if this is just a common technical analysis placebo or if others have found genuine value in this approach. The simplicity is appealing, but I wonder if I'm missing something more sophisticated.If anyone's interested in checking out my visualization tool (completely free, no signup), I'd love some feedback. It's at [200dma.com](http://200dma.com) \- just a clean, simple chart that shows price vs MA with the percentage difference calculation.What other technical indicators do you find most valuable?

I am mainly a value investor but over the years using super basic technical analysis helped me find entry / exit points...

1j0u583,Half a year looking back. Paying down mortgage early is a better investment,"Just so you know, half a year ago, I was debating if I shall pay down my 7.785% mortgage or shall Ininvest that money in the stock market.

Most redittors suggest paying off, I wanted to invest that money.

So I did half and half. I paid down half of the balance and left half.

The half balance I invested generated (4% to 14%) return on paper. 8% is kinda the median return after half a year. considering the tax benefit of carrying a mortgage, I‘d say paying down the mortagage is a better investment. the cut off is around 7%. So if your mortgage is 7% or lower, you shall invest, but if your mortage is 7% or higher, you shall pay it off. It’s a magical arbitrary number that worked for me.

FYI

  
Edit 03/01

6 month return is cumulative, not annualized. so if next 6 month’s stock market is gonna performing similarly, the half balance invested in stock market would generate a 8% to 28% annual return, median 15% ish. but no one has a crystal ball. I’d think paying down is still the best bet, considering how volatile the market is this year.

1j0olyt,Thoughts on Jeremy Siegel and stock only investments for 15+ year timeline?,"I was presented a newsletter with the following passage, given the current volatility in the market.

""Wharton professor, Jeremy Siegel, analyzed stock and bond returns in his classic book, ""Stocks for the Long Run"" (6th edition 2022). His research goes all the way back to 1802 (the very long run indeed) and concludes, not surprisingly, that over one and two-year periods stocks are much riskier than bonds. But across every 5-vear holding period since 1802, the worst performance for stocks, at -11.9%, was only slightly worse than the worst performance for bonds, -10.1%. (Incidentally, the best rolling 5-year period for stocks was +27.3% per year whereas the best for bonds was 17.7%/ yr). For every 10-vear holding period, again going back to 1802, the worst stock performance, -4%/yr, has actually been better than the worst bond performance, -5.4%/yr. (The best rolling 10-year period for stocks was +16.8%/yr; the best for bonds, 12.4%/yr). And across every 20-vear holding period stock returns were positive every single time, the worst being growth per year of +1.0%. The worst 20-year period for bonds was -3.1/yr. (The best rolling 20-year period for stocks was +12.6%/yr, and the best for bonds was 8.8%). Making these figures look even better is the fact that all of these percentages are real returns after inflation.

Siegel sums it up as follows (our emphasis added): ""The probability that bonds and savings accounts have frequently outperformed stocks in the short run is the primary reason why it is so difficult for many investors to stay in stocks. But it is very significant that in the more than two-century history of financial returns, stocks, in contrast to bonds, have never delivered a negative real return over periods as short as 17 years. Although it might appear to be riskier to accumulate wealth in stocks rather than in bonds over long periods of time, for the preservation of purchasing power, precisely the opposite is true: the safest long-term investment has clearly been a diversified portfolio of equities.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j0olyt/thoughts_on_jeremy_siegel_and_stock_only/,1740794618.0

The Atlanta Federal Reserve is projecting a contraction of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) of 1.5 percent in the first quarter, flashing a warning sign for the U.S. economy.

The projection is a significant shift for the Atlanta Fed over the last few weeks that comes a little more than a month after President Trump took office.

The Atlanta Fed last week was predicting 2.3 percent positive growth for the first quarter. A month ago, it was registering 3.9 percent growth.

The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow measure is not an official forecast but rather a running estimate of real GDP growth based on data as it comes in.

The first quarter ends at the end of March, and GDP will be officially calculated by the Commerce Department.

But the forward-looking indicator’s major drop will still be of significant concern to policymakers, economists and markets alike, especially as fourth-quarter GDP registered a strong second estimate this week.

GDP from October to December came in at a healthy annualized rate of 2.3 percent, as reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday. Third-quarter growth came in at a robust 3.1 percent, and second-quarter growth came in at 3 percent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j0li18/atlanta_fed_predicts_15_gdp_growth_in_first/,1740785296.0
1j0kh00,Where can I inform myself about potential investment opportunities?,"Hello investors,

I would say I'm familiar with the basics of investing. The majority of my portfolio is in VWCE because I'm not a professional investor (and even if I were, VWCE would probably outperform me in the long run). I will still allocate most of my investment funds to VWCE.

However, over the past two years, I've invested a portion of my money (money I was willing to lose) in stocks of companies I personally selected, and it has really paid off for me (at least so far). I believe I was able to accurately assess the investment opportunity because I work in that industry and immediately ""saw"" that a particular investment made sense.

Since investing isn't my full-time job, I'm wondering **if you have any recommendations on where I can get information on potential investment opportunities?** In other words, I'm looking for a website, forum, subreddit, or Substack—anything written by credible authors who are successful investors (those who have consistently outperformed VWCE) and who offer their suggestions on where to invest. Of course, I will focus on investing only in companies that align with my industry or where I clearly understand, based on my own experience, why the investment makes sense, even if I don't directly work in that field.

On one hand, there's no rent coming in right now, so it would just be the cost vs what it could be rented for, but that doesn't account for the value of the property which is paid off.

I think the better way to compare would be the property's value plus the cost of a remodel vs what kind of return that could generate. For example, say the remodel is 80-120k and it could sell for 150k as is or for 350k fixed up and rent would be 2600. The remodel would be worth doing so to rent it the ""cost"" would be 450k and after expenses rental income would be like 23k so that would be 5% return which is comperable to a conservative allocation.

From what i can tell, ""broad exposure"" ETFs seem to be larger (in niche industries) and so therefore better in the sense that it's not cheap to ""roll your own ETF"". The targeted ones seem to smaller and a) you really gotta do your homework and b) you may not agree with the picks

1j08dlv,Move some $$ out of U.S Index funds and into foreign ETF’s ?,"Hi all, I’m thinking about selling off $25K of U.S. index funds in a 350,000 portfolio to hedge again recessionary factors, fears over tariffs, etc…we’ve seen how the market has performed in the last week.  I am not panicking wide-scale, but I have lost about 10% in my overall portfolio and 50k in just the last week alone.  I know that is not a lot for some folks, but it is to me and I’m getting a bit more concerned if this trend continues.

With this in mind – again was going to take 25k out of the index funds and place in the following:

11k: **Coca-Cola**, I know it’s a U.S. equity but it seems recession-proof and W. Buffet says it’s a stock he will never sell from his portfolio.  Obviously has foreign exposure too.  Pays about .50 dividend/qtr.

9k: **DXJ:** Japan ETF which invests in all of the large Japanese CO’s with their associated divi’s. Hedges against instability vs. U.S. dollar as well and other factors.  Buffet has also been recently moving $$ into Japan’s market.

5K: **EUAD**: European-defense and Aerospace ETF: holds Rolls-Royce at about 12% which seems to be a darling of the market lately.

I mention the Divi’s only in passing for awareness, performance is more important to and to hedge against U.S. instability at the moment (hopefully not next 3-4 years).  Again most of my $$ stays in the U.S. market – I just wanted to see what others thought of this plan.  

The 2 ETF’s are rated as 5\* by Morningstar and you can look more into their yearly/historical splits which have been good.

Thanks.

I'm in my mid-30s so I have some risk tolerance, and looking to build over time without checking day to day market movements. Generally stocks that do not distribute a dividend would be simpler for me, but I'm not sure that dividends can be entirely avoided in my situation. What would you do within these parameters? I'd be very curious to hear if anyone else has managed such a situation.

Some stocks on my shortlist include: BRK.B, AMZN, WMT, MSFT, AAPL, BLK, but I'm very open to hearing other suggestions or why these are a bad plan.

1j05b0z,Dow Jones - Market Crash Incoming or Perfect Buying Opportunity?,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has been on a wild ride lately. As of February 27, 2025, it closed at 43,239.50, down 0.4% for the day. 
In contrast, the S&P 500 fell 1.6% to 5,861.57, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.8% to 18,544.42. 

These declines followed President Trump's announcement of new tariffs: 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, and an increase to 20% on Chinese products, set to take effect in March and April.

Beneath the surface, cracks are forming. The recent market downturn is attributed to fading AI hype, persistent inflation, and looming economic uncertainty. Notably, Nvidia shares plunged 8.5% despite reporting better-than-expected earnings, signaling waning enthusiasm in the tech sector.

Adding to the concern, the CNN Fear & Greed Index has plummeted to 21, indicating ""extreme fear"" among investors. Historically, such levels of fear have been associated with market bottoms, suggesting a potential for a rebound.

Given these mixed signals, I foresee a potential correction dragging the Dow down to the 42,160 area. Overheated valuations, rising geopolitical risks, and exhausted bullish momentum could trigger a major pullback.
Are we on the verge of a major correction or will the bulls push through?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j05b0z/dow_jones_market_crash_incoming_or_perfect_buying/,1740741132.0
1j054e8,Can Algorithmic Investing Reduce Emotional Bias and Improve Long-Term Wealth Growth?,"Many investors struggle with emotional decision-making—buying high in excitement and selling low out of fear. Studies show that the average investor underperforms the market by nearly 4 percent per year due to panic selling and overtrading.

But what if investing was automated, rule-based, and optimized for long-term growth?

# The Concept of Algorithmic Investing

Instead of relying on emotions, algorithmic investing follows predefined, data-driven strategies to manage portfolios. It is not about day trading or chasing short-term profits but creating a structured, disciplined, and automated investing approach for sustainable wealth growth.

# How It Works

* **Passive Investing Automation** – Set rules for periodic investments (ETFs, Index Funds, SIPs) and let automation handle execution.
* **Portfolio Rebalancing** – Automatically adjust asset allocation based on market conditions.
* **Risk Management and Hedging** – Use strategies like stop-loss automation or options hedging to protect capital.
* **Tax-Efficient Investing** – Optimize tax harvesting to minimize liabilities.
* **Hybrid Investing and Trading Strategies** – Balance long-term investing with short-term tactical adjustments.

# The Key Benefits

* **Removes Emotional Bias** – No impulsive buying or panic selling.
* **Rule-Based, Data-Driven** – Every move is backed by logic, not speculation.
* **Works Round the Clock** – Unlike human investors, algorithms do not get tired.
* **Customizable Strategies** – Investors can create, adapt, or even monetize their strategies.

# What I Want to Know

I am curious about the investing community’s thoughts on algorithmic investing for long-term wealth building rather than short-term trading.

* Do you think automation can improve long-term investing results?
* What risks or challenges do you see in trusting an algorithm over human judgment?
* Would you personally use an algorithmic strategy for investing, or do you prefer hands-on control?

Looking forward to the discussion.

1j029q6,$SANA - Biotechnology company poised to bounce back,"**TL,DR:** Monday SANA Biotechnology will present 8 week interim analysis from their clinical trial curing diabetes, at 4 weeks it was perfect and spiked the stock to 7$, similar will occur Monday/Tuesday and at the 12 weeks analysis results at their earnings call March 23rd. 

Background: I'm a biotechnologist with a PhD in Immunology (but only from France so what the fuck do I know) and I mostly play biotech companies.

SANA Biotechnology was overhyped as fuck when they IPO'd, so everybody and their grandma gave them a nice cash cushion which they blasted through for a couple years. What did they get? Well I'll tell you what they got now.

They have a cell engineering platform which lets them turn cells into pancreatic beta islets, the cells that naturally react to your blood sugar and regulate it via secretion of insulin, and they have a ""hypoimmune"" platform which knocks out the receptors for both T and NK cells so that these cells do not get attacked by the adaptive immune response, meaning they can mass produce pancreatic beta islets for transplantation into people. Nice in theory, so what can you use this for?

Well, it cures diabetes by a single injection depositing the cells under a belly muscle. How well does it work? They cured diabetic mice for at least 14 months, and they cured a diabetic monkey for 6 months before intentionally killing the cells. And, most importantly, in November of last year, they started their first phase I clinical trial in Sweden, with a single participant so far. [On January 7th, they presented the first analysis 4 weeks after injection](https://ir.sana.com/static-files/33b2aa85-6fb6-47cf-baa5-f97b587c8227), showing that their cells survive and are indeed not rejected by the immune system. This caused the stock to briefly spike from 1.7$ to 7.3$ before settling again and trending down over the past month again. But here's the thing - we know already that the treatment works in monkey and mouse for longer term, and as an immunologist I can tell you that if they aren't rejected after 4 weeks they likely won't be rejected after 8 or 12 weeks either, especially when it worked that way in monkeys.

SANA is presenting their interim analysis of 8 weeks on Monday , and I am expecting the results to confirm that their treatment continues to work, and they will be the first US company to cure diabetes this way. Another reason why I am confident this will work is that the Chinese have already done it ([but without hypoimmune platform, they just inject beta-islets with immunosuppression](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01022-5)). On their earnings call (March 23rd) they will present the 3 months interim analysis and everybody will want to get in on this technology.

Last September, they were sitting on 200 Million in cash after losing 60 million per quarter, no debt, they expect their cash to last through 2026. The current results, if as positive as I expect them to be, will give them enough leverage to raise more cash in the mid-term and survive long enough to fulfill the hype of their IPO.

The bear case? They run out of cash and get bought up for cents on the dollar and all the profits go to who buys them. Alternatively, in 6 months the cells grow into a tumor and their killswitch antibody doesn't work and now the patients have a hypoimmune tumor, company goes bankrupt from getting sued. I'm willing to bet that doesn't happen.

My position: 

2000 @ 1.77$ bought Jan 6  
3000 @ 2.60$ bought today at close

I know, pitiful, but I'm literally running out of cash (Just finished my PhD, European income level). This is not investment advice, do your own research.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j029q6/sana_biotechnology_company_poised_to_bounce_back/,1740727726.0

I’m currently only putting 3% into my 401k. My employer matches 30%. I make 100k per year. Due to my financial situation, I really cannot afford to contribute any more at all.

My question is, should I start maxing out my 401k to get the employer match and then pay myself back the difference from the loan/emergency fund? Or should I put the emergency fund into a HYSA or something like VOO?

1izxbee,"Microsoft: Growth, Investments, and Future Valuation in AI and Cloud Dominance","* Microsoft’s stock has been stable, trading around $402.85, with a market cap of $2.96T.
* Cloud and AI are major growth drivers, with Azure revenue up 31% YoY and AI services growing 157%-175%.
* Heavy CapEx investment of \~$80B affects short-term cash flow but aims for long-term AI/cloud leadership.
* Valuation suggests a potential price target of \~$500 by FY2026 if growth expectations hold.
* Risks include declining free cash flow, valuation compression, and AI adoption uncertainty.
* Microsoft’s quantum computing efforts focus on topological and neutral atom qubits, aiming for scalable quantum hardware.
* Security is a key pillar, with over $20B in revenue and AI-driven threat detection processing 65T signals daily.

Microsoft (MSFT) is maintaining its market leadership worth nearly $2.96 trillion. The market cap of its stocks is currently $2.96 trillion, currently trading at $402.85, reflecting its stable and firm trend over this year, ranging between $385.58 and $468.35 during a 52-week trading. While there have been minute movements in its stocks, its trend in total is generally sideways. Financially, Microsoft performed well in FY 2024, with its revenues improving 15.7% yearly, amounting to $245.1 billion, and earnings improving 21.8% to stand at $88.1 billion. The company’s consistent numbers support its growth prospects in its business divisions. Despite the challenges of escalating capital investment and increasing competition in AI, Microsoft's strategic investment in AI and cloud continues to drive growth. They are well positioned for stability in the long term and success in the future in a transforming technology landscape due to their investment in AI solutions, business solutions, and growth in the cloud.

Microsoft’s collaboration with AI models will offer the company tremendous growth in the near future. Since the explosion of AI, the Microsoft Azure program has become invaluable to other enterprises looking to integrate AI into their platforms. The high quality of Azure’s programs is a massive growth driver for MSFT. It has experienced a YoY revenue growth of 31%, which is over 3 percent above the predicted 5-year CAGR of AI models. Microsoft Cloud itself also experienced a notable 21% YoY increase in revenue and 12% growth in revenue in Q2. In January of this year, MSFT gained permission to add the Open AI model to their neural network, Copilot. These companies’ collaboration takes advantage of the $13B revenue run rate (predicting future revenue based on a company’s current revenue) of AI models and their YoY growth of 157%–175%. MSFT’s AI programs will gain huge amounts of revenue from the 345 million users using its services.

Microsoft is making a massive investment in its future, expecting to spend around $80 billion on capital expenditures this year - nearly double what it spent just a couple of years ago ($44–$55 billion). Most of this money is going toward building AI-powered data centers and expanding its cloud infrastructure, ensuring the company stays ahead in the rapidly evolving tech space. In the short term, this aggressive spending is putting pressure on free cash flow (FCF), which was about $70 billion over the past year and even saw a 29% drop year-over-year in Q2 FY25. But Microsoft is playing the long game—by fiscal 2026, FCF is expected to recover to $82.38 billion as these investments start paying off. This is a familiar playbook for Microsoft, much like when it bet big on cloud computing years ago. The short-term financial squeeze is real, but the payoff could be enormous, setting Microsoft up for 15+ years of sustained growth and solidifying its position as a leader in AI and cloud computing.

In terms of current valuation metrics, Microsoft's current stock price as of February 1st, 2025, is 121.95, and the forward P/E ratio is 33.4x. Additionally, its expected earnings per share (EPS) for Fiscal Year 2026 is $15.04, as well as a 12-month target price of $490, based on earnings growth and valuation expectations. In terms of projected price target calculations, the standard valuation formula is used, and via the given EPS for 2026 and P/E ratio, it is projected that the stock price by the end of fiscal 2026 will be approximately $500. This, however, is under the pretext that Microsoft maintains a P/E ratio of 33.4x. Stock valuation fluctuates based on market conditions; thus, if the market decides that Microsoft deserves a lower valuation, for instance, a P/E ratio of 30 instead of 33.4, the target price would change, falling to around $451. This suggests that if Microsoft’s stock trades at a more conservative multiplier, the price might be closer to $451 instead of $500. Microsoft's Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is at 13.3%, meaning that Microsoft's stock would be growing at a healthily above-average rate compared to the broader market. Microsoft's cloud computing (Azure) and AI services are key growth drivers as AI-related revenue is projected to exceed $10 billion annually, growing at 175% year-over-year. The growth of overall revenue, at approximately 12-13% per year, supports earnings growth. The growth margins are expected to be 68-70% in FY 2025 and FY 2026, indicating profitability, and the Free Cash Flow (FCF) is expected to exceed $65 billion in FY 2025 and $72 billion in FY 2026, meaning that Microsoft has money to reinvest or return to shareholders. However, risks include the fact that their valuation relies heavily on AI expansion; therefore, if AI adoption slows, the stock might not meet growth targets. Additionally, a declining P/E ratio could bring the price closer to $431 instead of $500. Competition also plays a key role, as rivals such as Google Cloud and AWS (Amazon Web Services) are also growing their AI and cloud businesses, which could impact Microsoft's market share and interest rates. Finally, economic conditions influence investor sentiment, ultimately affecting stock valuation. Overall, Microsoft remains a strong investment, but future performance depends on AI adoption, earnings growth, and maintaining investor confidence.

Microsoft integrates security into its cloud and AI strategy with a Zero Trust approach, AI-driven threat intelligence, and a unified security platform. Its key security solutions include Microsoft Defender, an AI-powered XDR for endpoints, cloud, and email; Microsoft Sentinel, a cloud-native SIEM and SOAR for real-time threat detection; and Microsoft Entra, an IAM solution with multi-factor authentication, conditional access, and identity governance. Microsoft’s cybersecurity business is rapidly growing, generating over $20 billion annually at a double-digit rate, serving 785,000+ customers, and investing $1 billion+ annually in security research and development. AI-driven security processes 65 trillion signals daily, enabling real-time threat mitigation. This robust security framework strengthens Azure adoption, AI deployments, and enterprise trust, making security a growth driver rather than an add-on. By embedding security across its cloud ecosystem, Microsoft reinforces its leadership in cybersecurity while accelerating Azure and AI innovation.

TL;DR: Microsoft maintains market leadership with a stable stock price, driven by AI and cloud growth. Heavy CapEx investment impacts short-term cash flow but positions the company for long-term gains. Valuation suggests a price target of \~$500 by FY2026, but risks include free cash flow declines and AI adoption uncertainty.

1izx87u,Celsius (CELH) Q4 Analysis: An Incredible Moment for Growth,"* Celsius Holdings (CELH) is set for a major turnaround in 2025 after a challenging 2024.
* The $1.8 billion Alani Nu acquisition strengthens Celsius’ market position and financial flexibility.
* Post-acquisition, Celsius holds a \~16% market share, competing with Red Bull and Monster (\~30% each).
* Q4 earnings were impacted by PepsiCo inventory corrections but show strong international growth.
* Valuation remains discounted (\~3.5x EV/S) compared to Monster (\~6x EV/S), signaling potential upside.
* Global expansion, PepsiCo partnership, and strategic positioning create long-term growth potential.
* Execution risks, competition, and consumer preference shifts remain challenges.
* Investor sentiment has been positive, with a 20% stock rally post-announcement.

Celsius is on the verge of a major turnaround in 2025, driven by strategic initiatives aimed at revitalizing growth and market position. After a challenging 2024 marked by supply chain disruptions, inventory mismanagement, and revenue declines, the company has made a decisive move to strengthen its foothold in the energy drink market. The acquisition of Alani Nu, a rapidly growing functional beverage brand, signals a new era of expansion and profitability for Celsius. As a brand that has successfully captured the attention of Gen Z and Millennial consumers through a strong social media presence and health-conscious product offerings, Alani Nu aligns seamlessly with Celsius’ mission to dominate the “better-for-you” energy drink segment. The $1.8 billion deal, executed at a 3x sales multiple, not only enhances Celsius’ revenue potential but also provides a $150 million net tax benefit, bolstering the company’s financial flexibility. Ultimately, this report aims to provide an in-depth analysis of Celsius Holdings’ strategic positioning after the Alani Nu acquisition, examining its market competitiveness, financial performance, valuation outlook, and future growth potential.

Alani Nu was founded in 2018 as a female-focused, functional beverage and wellness brand catering to Gen Z and Millennial consumers. Its strong social media-driven marketing strategy allowed it to double its sales in 2024, contributing to rapid market share expansion. Meanwhile, Celsius struggled with a 31% decline in third-quarter revenue due to supply chain disruptions and inventory mismanagement. The $1.8 billion acquisition reflects a strategic effort to strengthen Celsius' position in the energy drink market. With a 3x sales multiple valuation and an expected $150 million net tax benefit, the deal significantly enhances Celsius’ financial outlook and growth trajectory.

Post-acquisition, Celsius commands approximately 16% market share, still trailing industry giants Red Bull and Monster at \~30% each. However, Celsius' focus on zero-sugar, health-conscious beverages positions it to capitalize on growing consumer demand. Acquiring Alani Nu broadens Celsius’ consumer base, particularly among female and millennial consumers. The deal is expected to yield \~$50 million in synergies and open international expansion opportunities, further strengthening Celsius’ ability to compete with market leaders.

Celsius reported Q4 revenue of $332.2 million (a 4.3% Y/Y decrease), surpassing analyst expectations of $326 million. PepsiCo’s inventory corrections negatively impacted sales, leading to a 6% decline in domestic revenue to $312 million. However, international revenue surged 39% to $20 million, reflecting strong global demand. Despite near-term challenges, the company remains fundamentally strong and well-positioned for future growth.

Celsius’ current valuation (\~3.5x EV/S) is significantly lower than Monster’s (\~6x EV/S), making it an attractive investment opportunity. Historically, Celsius traded at \~8x EV/S, and with projected 2025 revenue exceeding $1.6 billion, the company is positioned for a strong recovery. The Alani Nu acquisition is expected to be a major growth driver, unlocking significant revenue potential and enhancing overall market positioning.

Key risks include execution challenges related to integrating Alani Nu, competition from entrenched players like Red Bull and Monster, and evolving consumer preferences in the energy drink sector. Global expansion presents both opportunities and obstacles, including regulatory hurdles, supply chain complexities, and marketing adaptation to diverse consumer bases. Successfully addressing these risks is critical for Celsius to sustain its growth momentum.

Celsius plans to leverage Alani Nu’s brand recognition for international market penetration, targeting key regions such as Europe (UK, Germany, Netherlands), Asia (China, Japan, South Korea), and Latin America (Brazil, Mexico). Challenges include regulatory compliance, supply chain logistics, and marketing adaptation. The PepsiCo partnership offers a significant advantage, providing access to a well-established global distribution network that can accelerate growth.

Investor reactions to the Alani Nu acquisition and earnings report have been highly positive, driving a 20% stock rally post-announcement. Celsius’ valuation discount compared to Monster presents a potential upside for investors who believe in its long-term growth. While Monster remains the market leader, Celsius' rapid expansion and strategic moves position it as a high-growth challenger.

The energy drink industry is growing rapidly, with a projected US market value of $50.8 billion by 2033 (8.3% CAGR). Consumers increasingly prefer natural ingredients and functional benefits, favoring Celsius' health-conscious offerings. Competitors like Monster and PepsiCo are expanding their functional drink lines, reinforcing the need for Celsius to sustain innovation and retail expansion while managing rising competition.

Beyond the Alani Nu acquisition, Celsius plans to sustain growth through product innovation and new market segments. Balancing aggressive expansion with profitability will be key, as leadership navigates challenges in an evolving industry. Potential new product lines and targeted market entries could further strengthen its competitive position.

Red Bull and Monster dominate the market, but Celsius differentiates itself with a strong health-conscious brand. The Alani Nu acquisition is expected to increase Celsius’ market share to \~16%. The PepsiCo partnership is crucial for distribution expansion and accelerated market penetration. Through strategic acquisitions, branding, and partnerships, Celsius is positioned for long-term industry leadership.

Celsius Holdings is poised for a strong comeback in 2025, driven by its $1.8 billion acquisition of Alani Nu. This move strengthens its market position, expands its consumer base, and enhances financial flexibility with a $150 million net tax benefit. While execution risks and competitive pressures remain, the company’s strategic initiatives, global expansion plans, and strong investor sentiment suggest significant upside potential. Celsius remains an attractive investment for those betting on its long-term success.

**TL;DR:** Celsius Holdings is set for a major rebound in 2025, fueled by the $1.8 billion Alani Nu acquisition.

While risks remain, strong investor sentiment, valuation upside, and global expansion plans suggest Celsius is a compelling growth opportunity.

1izw59g,Beware the SMBX: lost my shirt,"A few years ago I discovered the Small Business Bonds Marketplace (thesmbx.com) and was delighted to find one of my favorite restaurants in DC raising capital for an expansion and invested a grand. 
The platform is easy to use and offered a decent rate of return, 8 to 11% range. The repayments were going as planned, and I found another favorite neighborhood business, one whose owners I knew personally and trusted, and put in on a second investment that ended up being repaid early. At that point, I had a false sense of confidence, and also was very excited about the mission of the businesses that they were looking to promote, and added six others to my portfolio for a total of 15k in principal minus the others that I had already invested in. 

At some point in the last year, things started to go south and one business fell into default. Well, that sucked, but they ended up taking it to collections and hopefully would recoup something. But then it was a second business. And a third. And the fourth. And before long, five out of the six remaining investments were all in default and the companies folding. All I got from their customer service was a sorry not sorry, you got the prospectus - we’re just an intermediary and your funds were not really secure, I’m paraphrasing here. 

I am out several thousand right now and want to tell other investors to not be fooled by their great marketing and high rate of return returns, you are absolutely gambling in a way that in all of my years of investing I’ve never seen such poor win rates. They have their due diligence process, but I’m sorry, if five of six companies are folding, you have not done service to the investors who whose confidence you have built your platform on.

I have been looking to help him find the best strategy and one main thing that keeps popping up is the same advice of put it all into ""VOO and forget it""....but then I read other comments that say you can invest in dividend funds that would pay a nice dividend for that amount and if you DRIP it all back in then you would have large growth that would do better then the VOO in the long term.

1izqvi8,Over 30% of Nvidia’s revenue is concentrated in 3 customers,"Industry analyses suggests that these 3 companies are likely: 

1. Microsoft

2. Amazon Web Services 

3. Google 

I’m not personally invested in Nvidia. To Nvidia investors:

Does hearing that such a substantial portion of revenue is concentrated in 3 customers worry you? 

I know very little about the industry. I’ve heard, however, that both Amazon and Google are creating their own custom chips. If they scale up their chip-making operations, it could lead to needing to purchase less GPU’s from Nvidia. 

Also, making up such a large part of sales, doesn’t this give them increased bargaining power? It would seem that these companies are in a position of leverage to negotiate better pricing from Nvidia, which could reduce margins. 

Lastly, there’s a question of competition. Again, I don’t know much, but it seems that Intel and AMD are aggressively improving their AI hardware offerings. If they gain market share, Nvidia’s largest customers could look to start diversifying their suppliers. 

I’d love to get the Nvidia investors perspective on such a large part of revenues being concentrated in 3 customers. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1izqvi8/over_30_of_nvidias_revenue_is_concentrated_in_3/,1740691354.0

1izm44y,Strategy’s (MSTR) “Strategy” has you fooled,"Let’s do some simple math and tell you why this makes no sense.

First off, let’s realize that MSTR has been labeled as a “leveraged BTC play”

I’m here to show you why it is most certainly not.

If we look at its NAV as of today:

Total BTC: 499,096 x ~$86,000 (avg BTC acquisition price)

≈ $42 billion

Now let’s subtract debt and preferred stock

≈ $9 billion in total

Subtracting the debt MSTR has a value of about:

≈ $33 billion

Now let’s take that $33 billion and compare it to its original cost basis on all of its bitcoin purchases thus far:

499,096 BTC at an avg of $66,357

499,096 x 66,357 

… ≈ $33 billion

Now last time I checked, if we spent a total of ~$33 billion on BTC and now have a current value in BTC of about ~33 billion after considering debt… we made a 0% return!

Effectively this strategy has yielded a net of about 0$ at the current price of BTC…

(Obviously numbers were rounded here)

1izkzc2,"Curious about TSLA and co-mingling with SpaceX, Twitter, and Starlink","Musk's empire appears to be built primarily on the value of Tesla stock which has a P/E ratio of about 140 vs the more common 7-ish range.  If Tesla was valued similarly to other car manufacturers, the stock price would be around $15/share instead of today's prices in the $285 range or a peak value of around $480.

And part of that appears to be because Tesla continues to produce EVs even though they are not selling to get the carbon credits they then sell to other automakers.

All that said, he regularly [co-mingles assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-told-nvidia-to-ship-ai-chips-reserved-for-tesla-to-x-xai.html) and [personnel between projects](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html).

Even setting aside such items, since he uses the TSLA stock to leverage nearly all his other ventures, doing things like [buying Twitter and turning it into a more extremist site](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-x-twitter-antisemitism-hashtags-trending-hate-rcna151945) drove off advertisers, reduced the value of the purchased property, and both directly and indirectly harmed the value of TSLA by driving off both investors and consumers (generally, people who buy EVs are more likely to be left-leaning while the racists tend to prefer gas guzzlers).

On top of all this, he has a [history ](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/24/musks-twitter-has-been-sued-by-at-least-six-companies-for-unpaid-bills.html)of [not paying his bills](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/wiwynn-sues-elon-musks-xtwitter-over-unpaid-server-bills/#:~:text=Hyperscale%20server%20maker%20Wiwynn%20is,and%20is%20seeking%20%2461m).  And has been sued for trying to manipulate stock prices [through outrageous claims](https://www.barrons.com/articles/elon-musk-sec-lawsuit-twitter-d2640adc) and [non-disclosure](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/musk-sued-by-twitter-investors-delayed-disclosure-stake-2022-05-26/).

With recent TSLA value drops, there have been recent rumors (not linking/promoting these -- you can find the videos on YouTube, Insta, and TT if you want) that his recent activities are driving down the price and that he may try to saddle all his debt on TSLA then spin up IPOs for SpaceX and/or Starlink.

I already sold off my TSLA stock a while back, so I am not seeking personal financial advice.

I'm mostly curious about whether using TSLA to buy/fund these other companies and forcing the other shareholders in TSLA to bear the brunt of his personal decisions could give shareholders a legal interest in those companies.

Would this potentially prevent him from dumping all his debt on TSLA shareholders while starting a couple of IPOs to give himself a fresh start?

My parents have been retired from government jobs for the last 2 year, and have aproxaimtely $1.5 in their retirment accounts. They will both receive $6000/month between SSI and their govemernment pension. Over the last 2 years they have not had to dip into their retirment accounts and have comfortably lived on the SSI and government pension. 

The question is, do they need a financial planner/advisor if they could just leave their $1.5 million in the G fund (TSP plan) and not touch it. Is it worth the potential risk of moving the money out so the advisor can do their thing, or should it just remain there and while it may not grow a lot, it wont go down either. 

For their situation, of not touchign their retirement account, not needing an extravegant lifestyle, I am not sold on the financial advisor when they could get some basic return just it sitting there and getting a small return. 

Their goal now is to preserve wealth for my brother and I, and get that to us sooner than them passing. They will dip into it when needed, but they don’t have fancy life. I’ve tried to tell them to spend some, but we’ll see.

1izdbg7,"Why should I, as a retail investor, invest in crypto, knowing how whales manipulate the market?","The whales are mass liquidating while the crooks tell you this is a good time to buy on X. Then, after that, they will buy it cheap and go again for another ride. This is also well-coordinated with the bad news about tariffs; these crooks know how to play the game so well when there is less regulation!

This strategy only works if two conditions are met: retail investors must hold their investments, and they must buy after the whales pump it again. But here's a major problem: At some point, retail fatigue will set in and it's gonna be hard to regain their trust. This whole up-and-down, infinity glitch won't work forever without smart regulation.

So now the question is, why would I invest in crypto? It has no physical utility and people don't want to buy things with it. So they just hold in the hope that it will go up. Nothing make sense.

Here's another one, what is the point of decentralization if banks and whales are controlling Bitcoin? The thing that once was the main selling point of Bitcoin, is now turning against it, due to the lack of regulation.

Essentially using the S&P 500 as your lifetime “savings account.” You forgo paying off your mortgage early, and only keep enough cash for month to month bills and short term expenses. Every extra dollar goes into the S&P 500, no other allocations. Big expense comes up? Either sell some shares if the market is up, if the market is down, take out some margin.

I finally sold out of the VTTSX fund so I have a bit of cash sitting around. I don’t know if I should throw 100% of that into SWPPX or add in some international exposure. I was thinking something like the below:

80% SWPPX
10% SCHG (or SCHD???)
10% VXUS

1iyz491,Which Swiss stocks to pick for 2025 and beyond ?,"Hello

I wanted to diversify my portgolio and get more CHF as I like it as a ""safe currency"". So I was looking about which Swiss companies I could invest in and I must say I'm not very knowledgeable.  
I currently own SREN for a couple years already, around 40% up. I wonder if I should sell and take profit or keep holding, but as dividends are nice I'm leaning towards holding.

Except that I noted CMBN and SQN in the banking sector. While I'm confident about future for both SQN bumped so hard already that it's maybe not a good buy timing.

On the losers side I found STGN and LEHN while in the red I think both companies are still resourceful and may go up again, so should I consider it a stock sale or is it highway to hell ?

Lastly, for the sake of diversification I looked towards different sectors and found PSPN, DKSH and COTN which may look interesting imho.

But as I said I'm not very knowledgeable so if anyone has more insight than me about the market please share your thoughts.

Maybe I should stick with the biggest companies such as NESN, NOVN or UBSG but I'm not very keen about the idea. I may be wrong about this feeling tho.

I'm considering spreading my investment between 2 to 6 of those depending on the sentiment.

1iyyq9q,Self managed traditional IRA account with many small positions,"About a year ago, I took over my traditional IRA which had been professionally managed for a good while. It has a wide range of individual stocks like AAPL, AMD, AMZN, AVGO, AXP, BRKB, COST, CRM ... V, WBA, WMT (28 stocks and funds) for example, with share quantities ranging from 1 to 20+ for the individual stocks. Most, have really nice returns, but the quantity of each tends to be so small I question whether it would be wise to sell most and invest in a mix of SCHD, FXAIX, SCHG, FTEC, and FBGRX. I've already cleaned up a bunch of small quantity positions, but there are still a ton of them. I reinvested the proceeds into the funds above.

Would it make sense to sell most of these remaining small positions and concentrate those funds in selected ETFs and MFs as mentioned above? I've pretty much settled other Roth and IRA accounts into a mix of S&P 500, dividend ETFs, and growth funds. But this one account remains to be cleaned up and is worth around $135k-ish currently. 

I'm not generally a fan of bond funds, but do have about 6% in FXNAX. I've consolidated other stocks I sold into FXAIX and SCHD, about 27% and 29% respectively. And I put some in several growth funds too like FBGRX and FTEC, about 16% between them. So the remaining 20+ stocks comprise maybe 20-25% of the account. While I kinda like having BRKB, MSFT, NFLX, NVDA, META, etc., the share quantities are so low that I wonder if I would be better off selling them and reinvesting them in my core ETFs and MFs above. 

For the record, our current income is from Social Security, RMDs, and my wife who will likely work for 6 to 8 more years. I've been retired for years. The majority of our funds are in different Roth and 403b Roth and 403b IRA accounts.

I'm assuming the check will only be valid for 90 or 180 days.

Like, if I get the check issued from my 401k now, the market goes to shit for the next couple months, and then deposit it into my new jobs plan, would I potentially save a huge hit to my 401k?

1iyv78l,Am I approaching this rebalance correctly? Would love any feedback TIA,"Hello fellow investors and planners, I'm hoping to get any feedback on my proposed rebalancing plan. Right now I have vast majority of my money (approx $1M) in a Money Market account and I plan on rebalancing in the months to follow.

38M - overall NW \~ $3.7M. Living in VHCOL area. Kid under 1 year old and wife is making $200k+ annually.

I will likely be rolling my 401k (both trad and Roth) over to a rollover IRA as I recently left my job of 10 years.

Any recommendations to adjust %'s in any area?

* Giving consideration to lowering my Bond allocation to almost nothing and instead putting that money into SCHD or some dividend equivalent.
   * 100% will be doing this in my tax advantaged account but still on fence for my non tax advantaged.
* Am I crazy to consider some level of FIRE at this point?

Here is my breakdown plan. Total: $1.917M

* Money Market: $300k
* Stocks: $564k
* Real Estate Investment: $200k (locked for 5-10 years)
* ETFs + Bonds: $500k
   * Plan to split $200k Total US Market Fund / $150k International Equities Fund / $150k
* Roth IRA: $82k
* 401k: $234k
* Other: $37k

1iyujy6,How do we change from a financial advisor to a regular brokerage account without tax implications.,"My partner and I are soon to be married and will be combining finances.

My partner has had a financial advisor her entire career and has saved up $500k in investments. She has done everything through a financial advisor. I looked at her portfolio and essentially her advisor seems to be mimicking the S&P 500, just with individual stock picking.

We would like to get rid of her financial advisor, since they charge a 1.5% fee. However it seems complicated since her money is in a lot of individual stocks.

Our preference would be to go to Vangaurd to self manage and have a 3 fund portfolio of  VTSAX, VTIAX and VBTLX.

1iyqabg,Using promotional balance transfer to invest,"Anyone who reads just the title please read before replying. I'm fully aware you should never use credit to invest. But here is the situation I have. 

I have recently been investing with a real estate broker for a percentage return in real estate. I wanted to test the waters so I invested 25k into a project which was 9% stake in the property. After the project was completed, the property was refinanced, I got my 25k initial investment back and now I receive 9% of the monthly rent as well as 9% equity in the property. The turn around was about 6 months to get my initial 25k back. I am now receiving about $250/month in rent and I literally have to do nothing. The total project cost was 260k and appraised at 340k so on top of the rent I also have 7k in equity with the property, which I have the option to sell to another investor in the property or just hold out. The brokerage handles all property management, repairs, etc. I never have to come out of pocket again. This is all written in our signed contract. If a unit is vacant, my monthly amount goes down, but I am not responsible at all for any mortgage, bills, etc. Again this is all outlined in the contract. 


Now I have approximately 40k available to use as a balance transfer at a .09% rate with a 5% transfer fee for 16 months. I can get the transfer deposited straight to my account in cash. I don't plan on using the entire amount, but would it be a good idea to use a portion of that to reinvest that way I can retain some capital in a HYSA or CD. I understand there's always the risk of the project going over budget, which would be spread throughout all the investors, or something bad happening. But this brokerage has shown evidence of multiple successful projects. Just to confirm I would 100% have the capital available to pay off the card in full if something were to come up. I wouldn't be taking out money I didn't have.

1iyq88n,Fixed vs. volatile returns -- the two crazy uncles,"You have two uncles who have each done well for themselves and offer to give you some money. Your ""safe and steady"" uncle Bob and your ""dramatic but fun"" uncle John both offer to give you money over the next 20+ years, but you can only choose one or the other.

Uncle Bob offers to give you $500 on your birthday every year for at least the next 20 years.

Your uncle John is more of a character. He has a spinner he has created which has 40 slots on it, each of which has a different dollar amount, ranging from -$2500 to $2500. He shows you the spinner and 1/4 of the spots are less than zero, which means that you would actually give him money in that year. But the other 3/4 are all values from $0 to $2500. You average the values on the 40 spots and find that the average is positive $1000 (including both the negative and positive spots). Uncle John says that he'll spin the spinner once per year for at least 20 years and whatever amount comes up is what happens that year. If it's negative, you give that much to him, if it's positive, he gives that much to you.

Either uncle will give you this money every year for at least the next 20 years, maybe longer. But you can only choose one or the other, today, and you can't change it for the 20+ year duration.

1. Does my platform (Fidelity) add this loss to my cost basis for the new purchase automatically or do I need to enter this information somewhere on the app or my taxes? 


2. If I rebuy the stock (at a higher price than I sold) does it disallow me from ever taking a loss on that amount of shares of the stock or is the loss added to the cost basis and I can now sell the stock for a loss if it goes down?

CHGG still has value IMO. With a 100m$ market cap and top-line at 500m$, this is extremely undervalued.

How could CHGG make a comeback?

1. Students aren’t comfortable with answers generated by a single model. Chegg addresses this by providing answers from multiple models. They are adopting AI, and Chegg’s subscription fee is similar to that of a paid service like ChatGPT.

2. CHGG owns Busuu, a language-learning app. Highly regarded, it is now generating revenue as it grows in popularity and through partnerships with enterprises.

3. CHGG is still avoiding losses despite a significant drop in traffic, excluding one-off expenses. Service businesses are generally more adaptable and flexible in this regard, and Chegg’s cost-cutting initiatives are proving to be effective.

4. CHGG is likely to be acquired, as many businesses could integrate it into their portfolios. It has significant potential in the education industry and could leverage its Busuu language-learning app to expand into online courses.

5. CHGG has no history of share dilution in fact they are more interested in buybacks. Over the last 5 years Cheggs outstanding shares have dropped by over 20%. At a 100m$ valuation- they will be more interested now than ever before.

6. CHGG’s litigation over Google AIO, if turns out to be favourable will be advantageous.

1iyfh9d,Here’s my theory on why everyone should be buying Bitcoin.,"First off, I’m not saying to go all in and only buy bitcoin. Obviously you should have a diversified portfolio of stocks and ETFs too. But I’m going to argue why everyone should be buying bitcoin. Personally I just dollar cost average and buy the same amount every month and sometimes double it if there is a big drop.

My theory is based on the de-Americanization of the world and the probable removal of the dollar as the world reserve currency and the end of the petrodollar. Trump seems to be accelerating this process but the trends have been there for a while. It’s impossible for me to guess when this will happen but my theory is more based on the world being on that path.

BRICS is clearly a big part of this. I think this is what could most likely lead to the end of the petrodollar. They seem interested in creating a competitor to the dollar and trading oil in a different currency would be a good way to start.

I think we’ll start seeing a major reduction in the foreign appetite for US debt as the total rises. The other threat here is a devaluation of the dollar if the government decides to print more to pay the interest. That weakens the argument that the dollar should be the world reserve currency.

Brentton Woods is dead officially since Nixon. So I feel like the contract struck is dead too. It’s just a matter of time until other countries call us out on this.

I think when that really happens will be determined by the rate at which our military degrades. I think the real reason the world accepts the US financial domination of the dollar is that we enforce the ability to have international trade on the oceans.

Most international trade happens by sea. 90% by volume and 70-80% by value. This is only possible because the US has been the police of the sea since World War 2. No other country had the financial and military capability. And our war build up meant that for the first time we could. That is the macro economic paradigm we have existed in for 85 years.

This is also becoming less and less true. The Cold War saw the USSR and now Russia begin to challenge the US in oceans. They obviously can’t dominate the US but they can compete. More recently China has made major advancements. One example is the massive amphibious ship they just unveiled. This means we are moving from a uni-polar world to a multi-polar world. This makes the removal of the dollar as world reserve currency possible.

Africa unifying under an African currency is also an interesting idea but I don’t know enough about it to comment. But if it did happen it would be a big deal and a major move in that direction.

What does this mean for Bitcoin?
I think this is where the idea of Bitcoin being digital gold comes in. Bitcoin is known by most people in the world now. We’re seeing institutional and some national recognition. So there is already some “belief in its value”. We’ve already seen it be valuable to some people. I think when the dollar is no longer the world reserve currency and this fake idea of being pegged to physical value in Fort Knox ceases to exist other countries will choose not to peg their currencies to gold again. I think leaders are addicted to floating currencies at this point. I think a lot of countries will eventually opt to peg their own digital current to bitcoin because it already “has value” in the minds of the public and probably will even by that point.

I do think the price of bitcoin will need to stabilize to a degree for this to happen. But that’s a different subject.

1iyebe4,Talk me out of a utility focused portfolio right now,"Utility stocks, especially those with heavy operations in AI areas seem like a great play to me. 

Now the strategy could take time to play out, but when AI continues to grow, electricity demand will increase and they will be the ones setting the rates. (Data centers consume something like 2% of global electricity) 

Also, if we head into a period of market turmoil, they act as defensive plays that normally weather downturns, since people always need gas and electricity. 

Rates rising is the specter haunting this strategy of course. If inflation continues to rise and takes rates with it, debt payments will increase and utility profitability will suffer. 

Other than rates rising, this seems like a win-win scenario to me. On the one hand, you have utility stocks benefiting from AI electricity demand, and on the other hand, you have a portfolio of companies that pay high dividends and have a track record of weathering downturns.

This market is still euphoric - I guarantee many analysts have not been phased by the deep seek news - after this news every single person should have become skeptical of using forward p/e or as mentioned on Bloomberg “p/e”. 

What is trailing p/e vs forward p/e?

p/e represents the multiple that investors pay for each $ of company earnings

Trailing uses last years REAL earnings, for NVDA this is at ~50 (currently about +10 or more higher than all other stocks besides Tesla- which btw is still just a car company- check their income statement. 

Forward uses PROJECTED EARNINGS - this is your 30 p/e and if you’re no skeptical about this after the deep seek news

EUPHORIA

Edit: because some users seem to think I would never at any time buy a growth stocks based on this theory…

I 100% would buy growth stocks- in fact, I own some NVDA through ETFs and have owned even more up until very recently. My argument is that much of the calculation of forward p/e that makes NVDA seem relatively “cheap” at 30 is made up on high expectations that were pricing in immense amounts of demand that even without the deep seek news needed to be near perfect yet now we have all this macro news on top of that to make the risk higher.

I can go further by saying the market is as levered as it’s ever been with margin accounts accruing debits nearly surpassing the post-Covid inflation money printing bubble.

1iy6211,27 and starting to invest – looking for advice,"Hey everyone, I’m 27 and just getting started with investing. I do wish I had started earlier, but better late than never, right? I’ve read a couple of books, spent time on forums, and now I feel informed enough to build a basic portfolio. That said, I know I still have a lot to learn, so if any of my questions or reasoning seems off, feel free to let me know.

  
**My Portfolio (TFSA – Self-directed with WealthSimple)**

 

# Overall Allocation:

* **80% Equity, 20% Bonds**

Equity Breakdown (80% of Portfolio):

>**79.26% Growth** (Focused on long-term market appreciation)

>**VCE (Canadian Market, home bais):** **8.87%**

>**VEE (Emerging Markets):** **10.80%**

>**VFV (S&P 500 – US Market):** **21.57%**

>**XQQU (Nasdaq-100 – US Tech):** **17.51%**

>**ZCH (China-Focused Growth ETF):** **8.95%**

>**VIU (International Developed Markets ex NA):** **11.54%**

>**20.74% Dividend** (passive income)

>**VDY (Canadian Dividend Stocks):** 20.74%

Bonds (20% of Portfolio):

>Still deciding, but looking into VLB, VAB or another bond ETF. I’ve got $3k in cash waiting to be allocated. Open to suggestions!

# Other Accounts:

* **Emergency Fund(Conservative, enough to survive for 3 months):**
   * 50% in [**CASH.TO**](http://CASH.TO)
   * 50% in my checking account
* **RRSP:**
   * Late to the RRSP party as well, just started contributing aggressively and planning to max it out over the next couple of years(might even transfer from TFSA to RRSP). Thinking of the same allocation as above for my RRSP account.
* **""Fun"" Money:**
   * I put $1,000 into FBTC and IBIT(\~$500 in each). If it drops to $0, I’ll survive—it’s my ""let’s see what happens"" experiment.

My thoughts:

The portfolio is intended for long-term growth with exposure to Canadian, US, developed, and emerging markets. I know I’m heavily tilted toward the US market right now, but I’m evaluating the risk and if needed will consider reallocation. 

I trust this community to know what they’re doing, so I’m here for advice. Does this portfolio look reasonable? Should I tweak my allocations, or am I missing something important? 

Other info that might help: I’m okay with medium risk, investing for the long haul (25+ years), and plan to keep it passive. Let me know if there’s anything else I should consider or share to make this post more helpful! Thanks!

1iy5uvt,This sub is too sold on DCA and hold.,"The amount of people that push this is astounding to me.  Yes, it's historically been a valid strategy if your horizon is 30 years plus, but there's not many that can reliably say they won't need to tap their assets over that period.  There are spans of time in the not so recent past that would have you losing so much money that DCA and hold might delay your first home purchase more than 10 years.  Or if you had to unexpectedly raise a kid (happens to the best of us) having to sell when down to meet care expenses.  It's also true that past performance isn't indicative of future; and in my opinion this is more true now than ever.  The structure of our economy, the global economy, the strength of the dollar, and political stability are all shifting.  There are many scenarios that could put us into a long-term sideways market.

Outside of a 401k with retirement many years away or if you just so happen to be a lucky trust fund baby, I don't think it's a great idea.  Life is likely to throw stuff at you where you'll want or need to mobilize your money and it would suck hard to miss those moments or struggle through them because the market isn't doing well.

In a way, the amount of people in the retail market that think they can just ignore risk due to long term trends is what has me the most spooked about current valuations.  That's the kind of sentiment that makes especially nasty bubbles; when buyer sentiment is detached from risk valuations exceed rational and it doesn't take much to panic the herd.  There's quite a few similarities to the current market and the dot com market.  Look at what DCA'ing and holding would have done for you if you started in '97 and wanted to buy a house in 2010.  Congratulations, your strategy would of had you renting an apartment until your 40.

Stocks are a great investment in all but also planning for major events in your life and adjusting your risk exposure accordingly matters.  Blindly DCA and holding 100% something like QQQ is probably inappropriate for the vast majority of investors.

I think it’s tough to know how this will play out tbh.

I am contributing 25% of my income to my 401k, and going to contribute to an IRA for 2025. I'm also not buying avocado toast anymore, and living off rice and beans 😅

Any suggestions on navigating IRA investments still very welcome. Thanks to this wonderful community for responding to me in such great detail. ‼️

I have lived out of the States for a long time and am just getting around to beginning my retirement savings in the US. I'm 39 now and I have a 401k from my new job (slow but steady), and a little bit of money (slightly less than 10k) in my individual account.

FTQGX (16.75%) / SPHIX (12.81%) / FCNTX (16.79%) / FXAIX (10.36%) / FSPSX (6.76%) / FPADX (19.48%) / SCHD (17.04%)

Please, speak to me like I'm 10 - does anyone have suggestions on how I can navigate having much less than all my friends in their account, but still be able to eventually retire at some point in my life? Further diversifying with more EFTs and intl. stocks? Suggestions of which? All investments I have are from research I've done - hopefully they're okay.

1ixy4vz,Palantir at $87: Why This Dip Is a Golden Buying Opportunity,"* Palantir Technologies Inc. saw its stock plummet recently, falling to $87 per share after a wave of market jitters tied to CEO Alex Karp’s planned share sale and whispers of Pentagon budget cuts.
* The market’s response seems exaggerated, with Karp’s sale being a scaled-back plan and defense cuts potentially favoring Palantir’s strategic focus amid shifting priorities.
* Palantir’s robust fundamentals—AI leadership, growing government contracts, and commercial expansion—make this pullback an enticing entry point for investors with a mid-to-long-term horizon.
* This dip offers a chance to buy into a company poised to benefit from increased IT spending and its ties to influential figures like Elon Musk.

As of today, February 25, 2025, Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) has taken a hit, with its stock price sliding to $87 per share following a turbulent week. The drop kicked off after news broke of CEO Alex Karp’s intent to offload up to 9.975 million shares over the next six months, a move that could net him over $867 million at current prices. This came via a regulatory filing, though it’s worth noting he scrapped an earlier, heftier plan to sell nearly 49 million shares—context that softens the blow despite the initial panic. Then came reports of potential Pentagon budget cuts, with Secretary Pete Hegseth pushing for an 8% annual reduction over five years. Investors flinched, fearing Palantir’s lucrative defense contracts might take a hit. But here’s where I see the disconnect: the cuts target “low-impact” initiatives like diversity programs, not the AI and data analytics Palantir brings to the table. If anything, a realignment toward modernization and missile defense—areas Trump’s administration is prioritizing—could mean more business for Palantir, not less.

The numbers back up the optimism. Palantir’s stock may be down from its peak, but its fundamentals haven’t budged. The company’s leadership in AI-driven solutions, bolstered by its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), keeps it ahead of the curve. Its integration of advanced models like Elon Musk’s Grok from xAI only widens that lead, setting it apart from competitors like Microsoft. Government contracts with the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army remain a bedrock, and commercial growth is picking up steam. Posts on X echo this sentiment, with users pointing to Palantir’s free cash flow growth and high margins as signs of a “long-term winner.” Sure, the stock’s valuation isn’t cheap—trading at a forward P/E of around 162 and an EV/Sales multiple far above the sector norm—but quality tech rarely comes at a discount. History shows Palantir’s knack for rebounding from dips, like when it fell from $29 to under $9 between 2021 and 2022, only to roar back as revenue multiples tightened.

Then there’s the Musk factor. Karp’s vocal support for Elon Musk, now heading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), ties Palantir to a broader narrative of disruption and efficiency in government spending. Musk’s influence could steer budgets toward tech solutions like Palantir’s, especially as DOGE slashes wasteful contracts—$420 million already axed in its first week. Karp’s praise for Musk as a “builder” and his enthusiasm for “whatever is good for America” signal a synergy that could pay off. Analysts like Wedbush’s Dan Ives see this sell-off as a chance, holding firm on a $120 price target. Wall Street’s consensus leans cautious, with a mix of hold and sell ratings, but the median price target has climbed to $95—still above today’s $87. For me, this isn’t about next week’s bounce; it’s about 2027 and beyond. Palantir’s role in the AI revolution and its sticky contracts make it a stock worth grabbing while the market’s still wringing its hands.

**TL;DR**: Palantir’s drop to $87 is a buying opportunity. The market overreacted to Karp’s share sale and budget cut fears, but the company’s AI dominance and potential budget wins make it a solid long-term bet.

1ixxkgs,Floor & Decor: Growth Strategy Amid Economic Challenges,"Floor & Decor faces challenges in the housing market due to high mortgage rates, which limit turnover and new construction. Despite this, aging homes drive demand for renovations. The company competes against major retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's but aims for growth with new store openings while facing profitability pressures and a high stock valuation. In fiscal 2024, revenue increased slightly by 0.95% with profitability taking hits as well as EPS.

\*I DO NOT own any shares in FND & regularly post about companies that may be of interest to the general community

# Investment Thesis:

FND had yet another challenging year with sales growth of just under 1%. Profitability has taken quite the hit in the past two fiscal years with net income decreasing from $298.2 million in 2022 to $205.87 million in 2024. There has been a 30.9% decline over the two-year period. Macroeconomic challenges continue, including declining consumer affordability.

Additionally, there is a slowdown in new home purchases and starts. [According to the National Association of Home Builders](https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/press-releases/2025/01/housing-starts-end-2024-on-an-up-note), total housing starts for 2024 were 1.36 million, a 3.9% decline from 1.42 million in 2023. These factors have collectively led to softer demand in the home improvement sector. This has had a major effect on FND’s bottom line and future outlook. If there is a turnaround in the flooring industry in the years ahead, Floor & Decor will be a large beneficiary. It will experience increased demand and have the potential to gain market share.

# Key Factors

* **Promising Expansion Potential:** Floor & Decor has set a lofty strategy to target over 500 locations in the long-term from the 251 current stores. By the end of fiscal 2024, FND operates in 38 states. The company plans to open an additional 25 new warehouse stores in fiscal 2025. To support its expansion initiatives, the company has allocated between $330 to $400 million in capital expenditures. Between $200 million to $245 million is designated directly for new store openings. This investment will not only fund the opening of new stores but also the construction of additional distribution centers near Seattle and Baltimore in 2025 and 2026. FND’s expansion strategy to increase their physical presence, investing in infrastructure, and enhancing customer service could help to continue growing their market share against formidable competitors like Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Builders Firstsource.
* **Premium Valuation:** At the time of writing, FND trades with a P/E of 52.19 indicating a massive premium position. While this is nothing new as they have a five-year average P/E of 42.3, this is still a steep asking price to pay. Management has issued fiscal 2025 sales guidance between $4.74 billion to $4.9 billion representing growth between 6.3% and 9.9%. This outlook is seen as a positive development for sales. This is due to management’s expectation to see comparable sales being flat to 3%. Nonetheless, the valuation is excessively rich. The stock declining -14% in the past year is insufficient to justify confidence in future share price appreciation. Sure, the stock generally has maintained its premium label. This is despite tougher conditions and results. Still, the valuation remains too high to confidently buy at $94.27 per share even if they are a well ran company.
* **Tariff Concerns & Threats:** In fiscal 2024, 18% of FND’s products sold were produced in China. As uncertainty persists about future tariffs imposed, FND has taken steps to mitigate disruptions. These include negotiating lower costs from vendors, sourcing from different countries, and increasing retail costs due to inventory costs moving higher. With potential increased costs in the flooring industry, this could dampen consumer spending. It could also dampen housing market activity. Both are crucial for the growth of FND. The company’s performance is closely tied to the health of the housing market. A prolonged slowdown will lead to decreased demand as homeowners may delay renovation projects and new construction may decline as a whole.

# Conclusion

Floor & Decor is a great company with an attractive runway for long-term expansion with a strong balance sheet. However, despite its robust fundamentals, the issue stems from the current valuation. If the stock was trading around a 20-25 P/E, we could confidently recommend a buy. This is despite the secular tailwinds in recent years that continue to suppress profitability and strong earnings growth. With a premium valuation, you should expect strong performance. That simply has not been the case in recent years. Take for example fiscal 2025 expectations, growth between 6.3% and 9.9% does not support a company trading with a P/E of over 50.

Valuation aside, FND still presents a compelling investment opportunity. It has a proven business model and strategic growth initiatives despite the current housing market constraints. They have continued to gain market share against major rivals and have shown a history of great performance. Growth is expected to be its highest in three fiscal years which is a sign that stress is easing. When and if industry factors improve substantially, look for FND to be one of the major beneficiaries of an improving industry.

# Risk Factors:

*  **Interest Rate & Housing Market Sensitivity:** Floor & Decor’s business heavily relies on the residential housing market which is influenced by mortgage rates, home sales, and refinancing activity. Rising interest rates make buying and refinancing homes more expensive reducing home sales and renovation activity. A slowdown in new construction reduced the demand for FND’s flooring materials particularly from professional contractors. If the Federal Reserve maintains high rates for an extended period, FND may experience a decline in revenue growth. This could also affect profitability.
* **Increased Competition:** FND has a specialized advantage in the flooring space. This is due to their overall focus on providing extensive products and materials. Nonetheless, Home Depot and Lowe’s already sell similar items. They could increase their product offering to compete directly with Floor & Decor. Both large companies have major pricing power due to their size and supplier relationships. If they decide to lower flooring prices or offer exclusive deals to contractors, FND could lose market share that they have gained slowly in recent years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ixxkgs/floor_decor_growth_strategy_amid_economic/,1740497168.0

My real question is I am unsure what to do with that rollover IRA for the child's college - should I just leave it in there and pay for the taxes as I withdraw to pay for taxes (no penalty for college is allowed), or roll it over to another tax-savings construct like a 529 savings plan - I'm just doubtful I'll have access to the same funds / ETFs that have made it money these years (VOO, SPY to give just a couple of examples in the portfolio).

Below is a condensed report, drop me a PM if you want to know more. Also, if China stocks are not your thing, either risk-, political-, personal-, or other-wise, kindly ignore. I was not paid or sponsored to write this and do not have glowing EV or AI credentials, but I have been diligently researching and studying the EV industry (including Xpeng) since 2020.

**INTRODUCTION**

Xpeng is a Chinese EV maker headed by CEO He Xiaopeng, with dual listings in the USA and Hong Kong. Its current price as of today is around US$19.5 with a market capitalization of around US$18.6 billion.

But is it really just an automaker? I’d argue Xpeng is in fact a software company providing full-stack AI mobility solutions, and seems hugely underestimated by analysts and markets alike. Here’s why Xpeng could see large growth in the coming years, perhaps hitting US$100 by end-2026 (or \~US$100 billion market cap), using a simple SWOT analysis.

1. **Product & Design:** Xpeng’s cars have always had aesthetics in mind, with their latest P7+ and sub-brand MONA M03 sedans’ stylish looks, best-in-class comfort, and large space now huge bestsellers in China. Xpeng is now the 3rd best selling EV carmaker in China at the moment, behind BYD, Wuling, and Geely.
2. **Affordability:** Xpeng cars are kept affordable while retaining many luxury and tech features, providing good value-for-money.
3. **Cutting-edge Technology & Features:** Outstanding Xpeng tech includes an in-house powertrain integrated with the vehicle chassis, plus outstanding autonomous driving capabilities and smart features.
4. **Strong Leadership Team:** In 2023, CEO Xiaopeng and President Wang Fengying overhauled the management team, rooted out corruption, eradicated departmental inefficiencies, and shifted to a more user-centric focus. The CEO remains humble and fully committed to building the company to reach greater heights.
5. **Strong Supply Chain, Marketing & Branding Management:** After a tumultuous 2022 and 2023, Xpeng’s product, marketing, and supply chain teams are now all working harmoniously to swiftly ramp up production and deliver blockbuster hits one after another.
6. **Financials:** The [CEO has recently hinted at a breakeven quarter this year](https://cnevpost.com/2025/02/07/xpeng-expects-break-even-single-quarter-2025/), which will be a pivotal turning point for the company and change in valuation metrics.

**WEAKNESSES**

1. **Low Brand Strength & Perception:** Xpeng is slowly but surely growing its reputation in China and overseas, with stronger sales.
2. **Intense Industry Competition & Price Wars Creating Margin Erosion:** Might not necessarily be a weakness since competition breeds innovation and efficiency (see Deepseek). Moreover, Xpeng has several cost advantages, such as Gigapresses and joint raw materials purchases with partner Volkswagen.

**OPPORTUNITIES** 

1. **Strong 2025 Pipeline:** 2025 official target deliveries is 380–400,000. However looking at their strong pipeline, especially for L3 autonomous driving, I am forecasting 450–500,000 deliveries for this year, with a possibility of attaining 800,000+ EV deliveries for 2026.
2. **Autonomous Driving (AD) & Self Driving Cars:** Xpeng is a strong contender for this race, with the CEO declaring in January 2025 they will achieve Quasi-L3 AD by mid-2025 and Full L3 AD by end of 2025.
3. **Flying Cars:** Xpeng’s Land Aircraft Carrier (modular van and flying eVTOL module) will start deliveries in 2026 (no, this is not a wild going-by-faith projection, the [factory is currently under construction with target completion in 3Q 2025](https://cnevpost.com/2024/10/27/xpeng-aeroht-flying-car-base-breaks-ground/)). Their entry will shake up the low-altitude economy due to its mass production capabilities, cost advantages, and synergies with EV production and technology. But don't expect this business to have a huge impact on the stock by itself.
4. **Humanoid Robots:** Xpeng’s bipedal, all-purpose Iron Robots have already been deployed in Xpeng’s factories and stores, and are expected to enter trial commercial use in the second half of 2025, meaning commercial use may come in 2026, including **talking and moving like humans.** Much potential in this enormous space for Xpeng, which has several differences in its robot tech from its peers (with the CEO just saying he is confident [Xpeng will deploy one of the earliest mass-produced L3 robots in China](https://m.weibo.cn/status/5137890441693096)).
5. **AI Car Chips:** Xpeng will mass-produce their potentially game-changing Turing AI chip in mid-2025 (3x the computing power of industry standard Nvidia's Drive Orin-X), where it will set off a chain motion of new product launches. Possible to be adopted by other automakers too. Angus McKenzie from Motortrend has speculated that if Xpeng’s Turing Chip lives up to its full potential, it could be a [Deepseek moment for the car industry](https://www.motortrend.com/news/xpeng-develops-ai-chip-deepseek-moment/). 
6. **Robocars & Robotaxis:** The final step in autonomous driving (L4/L5 AD), and with endless possibilities: From transportation to food delivery to mobile convenience stores to F&B to ecommerce deliveries. Coupled with Iron Robot can achieve wonders in any industry.
7. **Global Expansion:** Xpeng car sales are accelerating around the world, with a targeted presence in 60 countries by end of 2025, compared to 30 as of end 2024.
8. **Increasing Partnerships & Institutional Investors:** Existing partnerships and investments by Volkswagen may deepen, and institutional investors (domestic or foreign) may start to invest in Xpeng as it becomes recognized worldwide.

**THREATS** 

1. **Competition:** There is always intense **price competition** in the EV sector, whether in China or overseas. However, Xpeng is in a sweet spot of value for money and product, and will continue to attract customers in the entry-level range. **Competition in autonomous driving** is fierce, and there’s a chance another car company unlocks L3 and L4 before Xpeng. However, Xpeng will get there eventually too, and it has other prospects, plus it can always catch up and outshine with its robocar offerings. Some may also be worried that **copycats** will mimic Xpeng’s popular car models bolt for bolt, but it’s not so simple as Xpeng has built up a decade’s worth of proprietary innovation and expertise in building cutting-edge EVs. And will continue to do so.
2. **Loss of Innovation:** Xpeng depends heavily on its tech innovation to stand out. Loss of key men may cause a brain drain and loss of technological edge. Xpeng is tackling this by recruiting the best and brightest, and heavily invested in R&D.
3. **Geopolitical Tensions:** I believe a **major war is very unlikely** under the current Trump administration. But increasing friction between USA and China may spark another call for **delisting of China ADRs**, which if comes to pass will create volatility in the stock prices, but I feel Xpeng’s stock will eventually recover and push higher as the company performs well (will have small forex risk though). USA may also decide to **tighten EV chip restrictions** on China automakers, but that will not affect Xpeng as it transitions to its own Turing Chip for all its products in mid-2025 (may turn out to be a boon instead as competitors falter).
4. **Global or Domestic Economic Softness:** Any economic slowdown in China or the rest of the world will have a mixed effect on Xpeng’s position as an affordable, mass market, smart EV brand. A slowdown could actually spur more consumers to go for bang-for-their-buck cars, and Xpeng fits the bill perfectly.

**SUMMARY**

Do you want to own a company that can potentially change the world? Xpeng could turn out to be the **Tesla of China, Figure AI of China, Archer Aviation of China, Nvidia of Cars: All rolled into one!**

The risk reward looks tremendously positive. And the worst case I can see right now is the stock goes sideways due to inexplicable stagnation in its domestic and overseas EV car business, PLUS all its other exciting prospects — Autonomous Driving, Flying Cars, AI Chips, Robots, Robocars — fall flat.

BUT, in a good scenario (not necessarily the best case even), if one or two of Xpeng’s businesses blast off? A review of each and my estimated valuations (now and end-2026, with estimated annual sales):

1. **EV Cars (Semi-AD)** — Current (**L2 AD**, 300K annual sales): US$18 Billion | End 2026 (**L3 AD**, 800K-1M sales + huge/growing orderbook): US$50–60 Billion *(Benchmarked against BYD & Li Auto valuation)*
2. **Flying Cars** — Current (3K orderbook): US$1 Billion | End 2026 (10K sales + 10–30K orderbook, depends on type): US$5–20 Billion *(*[*Benchmarked against Archer Aviation valuation*](https://investors.archer.com/news/news-details/2024/Archer-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-Demonstrating-Manufacturing-Certification-and-Commercial-Launch-Momentum/default.aspx)*)*
3. **Robots** — Current: Nil | End 2026 (5–10K sales + 10–100K orderbook): US$5–60 Billion *(Wildcard, Enormous potential,* [*Benchmarked against Figure AI valuation*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/robotics-startup-figure-ai-in-talks-for-new-funding-at-39-5-billion-valuation)*)*
4. **AI Chips** — Current: Nil | End 2026 (0–20K orderbook + partnerships): US$2–20 Billion *(Big wildcard at the moment)*
5. **Robocars (Full-AD)** — Current: Nil | End 2026 (10–50K orderbook + partnerships): US$5–40 Billion *(Enormous potential,* [*Benchmarked against Waymo & Tesla valuation*](https://www.barrons.com/articles/alphabet-waymo-stock-tesla-robotaxis-29a57e01) *with big haircut)*

Is this so ridiculous? Bear in mind Tesla’s sky high valuation for its future autonomous driving, robot, and robocar plays. Now Xpeng is valued at a mere 1.8% of Tesla. A major product breakthrough can trigger a sharp bull run for Xpeng, cause short-sellers to stay away, and maybe turn it into a meme stock. Just my 2 cents.

1ixvgjj,Interesting study that shows investing in solar is a good hedge against inflation - Data throughout the Americas,"Open access link: [https://doi.org/10.3390/en18040890](https://doi.org/10.3390/en18040890)

""Investments in distributed generation with solar photovoltaics (PV) present a promising opportunity to hedge against inflation, considering non-taxed profits from PV energy generation. To investigate that potential, this study quantifies the return on investment (ROI), internal rate of return (IRR), payback period, net present cost, and levelized cost of energy of PV by running Solar Alone Multi-Objective Advisor (SAMA) simulations on grid-connected PV systems across different regions with varying inflation scenarios. The case studies are San Diego, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Santiago, Chile; and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Historical inflation data are also imposed on San Diego to assess PV system potential in dynamic inflammatory conditions, while Boston and Santiago additionally analyze hybrid PV-battery systems to understand battery impacts under increasing inflation rates. Net metering credits vary by location. The results showed that PV could be used as an effective inflation hedge in any region where PV started economically and provided increasingly attractive returns as inflation increased, particularly when taxes were considered.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ixvgjj/interesting_study_that_shows_investing_in_solar/,1740491488.0

1ixpbyd,International ETFs With Higher Returns Than VXUS?,"What buy and hold international stocks/etfs do you like that you think may have higher future  returns than VXUS? There’s been lots of talk recently about international investments, but for years now, VXUS and just buying the entire world market, minus the US, has been the only one that I’ve really heard about, and the returns have been so significantly less than US stocks and ETFs.

One concern I thought of is that VXUS holds 8000+ companies. Considering that the S&P 500 is mostly driven by just a few companies, I’d like to see how an etf that was compromised of just a few hundred non-us companies performed. Also, I was curious about other EX-US etfs that might have good returns in the future in general, even if the US has poor returns

So far I’ve found 3 ETFs found that have caught some of my interest: 

BKIE- mid to large cap developed markets EX-US etf with just under 1000 holdings. This sounds a lot like what I was looking.The index it tracks also has had decent returns historically.

IDMO-based on the S&P World Ex-U.S. Momentum Index. Apparently the holdings are rebalanced twice a year based on a momentum score. I’m not sure if this rebalancing will be considered a taxable event in my account, but this index/etf also has good returns. After further reading, it sounds like ETFs following momentum indexes may be bad to hold during bear markets though?

Country/Region specific ETFs such as DBEZ- hedged eurozone etf. I’m not sure how an etf like this would do if the US dollar fluctuates wildly since it’s hedged, but it’s a choice if I want to focus on the eurozone.

So, what would you go with if you wanted to buy and hold and get reasonable returns? An etf for a specific region like China, Europe, or Australia? A momentum etf? An index like the developed market large cap? I’m curious what you think and if you have any other ETFs that you think I should know about.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ixpbyd/international_etfs_with_higher_returns_than_vxus/,1740467991.0

1ixnm9b,HYSA alternatives with better yield? I’m scared of stocks right now,"My portfolio is at the point where I’m looking to lean more toward stability than maximizing growth. I figure these tariffs are probably as good a reason as any to start implementing a more conservative strategy.

Previous strategy: max out 401k dumping everything into S&P 500 index funds with low fees, then whatever excess I had in taxable I’d stick the vast majority into VOO, then a little into QQQ, random stocks, gold, and/or crypto (mostly BTC, a little ETH). 

Pretty much have done this with every paycheck for the last decade or so. Has worked out. But as I approach retirement I want to transition to increased stability, less aggressive gains. And I don’t get the impression we have a particularly economically beneficial administration on our hands at the moment. So it’s time to pivot, for a number of reasons.

I know the traditional playbook is to weight your portfolio away from stocks and toward bonds, but I’ve never bought bonds before and don’t know where to start.

Do bonds have a better yield than 4.5% or should I just stick with hoarding cash in a HYSA? Should I be considering CDs or anything else? Is there another strategy you’re implementing, if you’re in a similar situation?

1ixmytu,Nuclear energy and AI stocks are heavily correlated,"I’ve been investing in nuclear energy stocks since before Covid. I suppose my reasoning for wanting to be involved in the sector was because I think it’s the energy of the future. 

A pellet of uranium, the size of a finger nail, can create the same amount of energy as 1 ton of coal, or 150 gallons of oil. (Roughly 1 MWh of electricity) 

The nuclear lifecycle creates minimal carbon emissions. And it’s 0 carbon emissions while actually producing the electricity. All of the carbon emissions come from mining, fuel processing, construction, and waste management. It’s on par with wind energy for lifecycle emissions without the drawback of being an intermittent form of energy. 

For some context here, nuclear energy produces 3-15 gCO2/kWh across the lifecycle while natural gas produces 400-500 gCO2/kWh. 

An unfortunate realization I’ve come to regarding the performance of nuclear energy stocks is that they’re heavily dependent on the performance of tech companies, specifically AI. Friday and today saw widespread declines across nuclear energy stocks because Microsoft noted less demand than they originally thought for new data centers. 

I understand industry plays a large part of the performance of energy deliverers, but it’s seemed that other energy companies are at least diversified across a range of sectors.

1ixiugj,What industries / companies will be durable in 20+ years?,"I am a fan of the long term buy and hold strategy. If the markets high? I buy it. If there’s a dip? I buy even more.

S&P is great, and by being 50+% VOO and a mix of mag 7, I’ve had excellent returns since 2020. With that said, I’m a young investor (27m), and I’d like to plan more intelligently for the long term. 

What industries, or companies, do you all believe will be around and thriving 20-30+ years from now?

For me, I think the culture of “tech” companies will continue to be strong with their hyper efficiency, monopolistic power, and acquisitive nature. So amazon, google, meta and Microsoft, will continue to acquire competitors and dominate all aspects of American life for years to come imo, but there are also dominant monopoly-like players in Walmart and Costco which I also believe will continue to rise and do in the physical world what the tech giants can’t/won’t. In terms of “what we’ll always need” in food, water, shelter, I’m less familiar with players that have the same level of dominance and will last. 

I think energy is the crisis of our time, but I’m hesitant to bet on any individual company at this point. I’m not sure if others have insight, but I’d love to hear arguments not for what matters this year, but what will matter in the longest term.

Situation: I held 246 shares of a stock since \~1/30/24.  On 2/20/25 I deposited  \~$40K.  Today, I sold 246 shares and attempted to buy another ETF with those funds and I was greeted with a ""This buy order was accepted without sufficient settled funds to trade in your account"".

However, the person I spoke to initially said this which makes me feels there is no limit if I can reinvest:

>**If you wish to reinvest the funds, they are available immediately after the sell order**, fills. If you wish to withdraw the funds, you are required to wait a minimum of one business day

>**If you sell something that was paid for with settled funds, then the funds are available immediately**.

This leads me to believe the funds are available immediately (Based on my interpretation of what she said above) as I did buy these shares a month prior.

>So it looks like the buy order of the shares occurred today. This means, the buy order was not settled when you decided to sell and that is why the funds are not available immediately.

The reinvestment buy order was completed right **after** the sale of the stocks that had been in my portfolio for a month.

>A good faith trading violation occurs when you buy a stock or investment with unsettled funds and then sell those new shares before the proceeds funding its purchase have settled. In other words, you sell stock 1, to buy stock 2. There is no issue with this, but when you sell stock 2 before the settlement period has passed for selling stock 1, this becomes a good faith violation. This has restricted your available cash until the trades settle.

Then she contradicts her original statement.  She said there was NO settledfund for reinvestment above.  How can they be available immediately after a sell order if the below is also true?

>So the rules I discussed about funds being available immediately after the sell does not apply due to the good faith violation on the account currently.

Then this when asking a about selling the shares I've held for a month.:

>Those are settled yes but sales have their own settlement. All trades require one business day to settle.

Then this LOL

ME:  
Ok you said this before ""If the funds used to purchase the shares were settled at the time of the purchase, they are available immediately after the sale.

>CSR:  
This would be true if you had not received a ""Good Faith Violation"" which restricts your account to ""settled funds only.""

And again later, to confuse me even more as they clearly are NOT available for reinvestment due to this good faith violation which I still don't understand as I sold something I've held for over a month

>They are available for reinvestment but considered unsettled.

So I asked:  If they are available for reinvestment what activity did I do this morning that prevented them from being able to be reinvested??

And then she leaves it with this when I asked what I could do to prevent this:

>If you anticipate and trade with regards to the settlement time of one business day for all trades, you will be good to go.

So I can reinvest same day then I can't, then I can.  I was able to reinvest in the stock I had just sold once I realized I was unable to purchase the stock I had sold for.  Why would that not violate this good faith clause?

Thanks, and sorry for the long winded question.

1ixfbwx,An Investment Warning Story,"For your ""entertainment"" :)

The year was 2002. A good friend's cousin joined a startup called ""What's For Free Technologies"" (WFFT). They were developing a website that people would visit to received free promotional items. Behind the scenes, they were securing agreements with big names in retailing and polishing up the website, soon to be released. The stock was regularly trading between $6-$10 and would ride these predictable waves. I started trading on paper and, with an initial $1000 investment, had made tens of thousands of dollars buying low and selling high.

I got some valuable information 3rd hand from the cousin that worked there - the company seemed to have had great success in securing deals, they hired an extra 50 programmers/employees for the website and everyone had just started to relocate into a huge, swanky commercial space. Morale was at an all time high. The website launch was in 1 month. I convinced my wife that investing now was the best move. I sunk in $1000 real dollars (which, at the time, was every penny we had saved).

Cut to the website launch day and I take the day off work to monitor my investment! Given that the stock (currently sitting predictably at $6) would rise to $10 without fail BEFORE the website launch, I had decided not to be greedy and would sell above $10 the very moment it seemed that it might be peaking. I would not hold out of greed. I was going to cut and run. My gut told me it might hit $14-$15.

Site launches. Stock briefly rises to $7 then back to $6. A hour goes by with little movement. Confusing, why aren't people excited about the release? Stock makes another surge to $7 before slowly settling to $6. It slowly drops to $5 reverses back to $6. I'm checking every 5 minutes. I can't understand, the stock has never acted this way. I called my friend who tells me that his buddy and the WFFT workers are all excitedly buying stock from their offices. He assures me, don't worry, this thing is gonna skyrocket! I'm excited again.

I watched as the stock slowly slid to $4 over the next hour or so. I call my friend back. He says his cousin (who works for WFFT) says there is some disappointment over the quality of the website but not to worry, the deals and partnerships are amazing. He said the management group has left the facility, he assumes to drum up some business, reminding investors that the cosmetics of the site will be improved but the value is there. The employees have food and champagne on ice, waiting for the stock to jump. The air, he says, is electric.

I watch as the stock goes $4 to $3 to $2...to under a dollar in less than 10 minutes. I'm stunned. I don't believe it. I call my friend. His cousin is raging. They got an email from the management group saying everyone is being laid off until further notice. I lost my investment.

Post mortem: the owners of the company propped up the share price by selling a lie. They didn't have many good partnerships and the website design sucked. They sold all their shares at one of the peaks and the price tumbled as confidence was eroded. At the end of the day, the company didn't have a valuable service, they knew it for many many months as they hyped up and sold shares, ultimately cashing out and tanking the stock and shuttering the company.

What’s the benefit in having a manager invest your money for you for 10+ years when the performance is lessened by their fees?

You can’t just walk into most stores and buy groceries or gas with it. Yet, every time it surges, people start calling it ""the future of finance,"" but that future never really happens.

I keep hearing about institutional money coming in, but if it’s mostly hedge funds and whales pushing the price up, how does that make it a real currency? If regular people are just there to provide liquidity for the big dogs, how is this different from a glorified pump-and-dump?

Don't get me wrong I'm a Bitcoin fan and have been buying and selling it for years now. But I cringe everytime I hear “It’s digital gold”.. Gold has a use beyond its speculative value. It can be made into jewelry, art.. People want to have it because its a ‘real’ thing you can hold in your hands! Bitcoin's only real use is making anonymous transactions that regular humans don't usually need to make.

Am I missing something here, or is Bitcoin actually just a bigger fool scheme?

Edit: When you ask the trading AI everyone on tiktok uses ([this one](http://trademind.ca))  It basically says Bitcoin isn’t a Ponzi because there’s no central scammer, no guaranteed payouts, and it still functions even when prices crash. It’s more like a scarce digital asset that people trade, kind of like gold but way more volatile. But that still doesn’t really answer why it hasn’t become a real mainstream currency.

A Comparative Analysis,"I've been analyzing leveraged ETFs (LETFs), particularly QLD (2x QQQ) and TQQQ (3x QQQ), to see how they compare with using margin to achieve the same leverage. My findings suggest that LETFs might perform nearly identically to margin investing—assuming competitive broker interest rates. However, I'm looking for feedback from the community to validate my approach.

# My Approach & Findings

1. **Simulating 2x Leverage on QQQ**
   * 100% **QLD**
   * Manually leveraged portfolio of **50% QQQ and 50% TQQQ**
   * Traditionally leveraged portfolio of 100% QQQ and another 100% QQQ that incurs daily interest
   * Initially, this approach suggested LETFs were slightly worse due to the drag from expense ratios.
   * However, when factoring in TQQQ (3x LETF) + QQQ (1x), the combined expense ratio actually outperformed a pure 2x margin strategy.
2. **Factoring in Interest Rate Costs for Margin**
   * To simulate traditional leverage, I incorporated the **federal funds rate** as a proxy for margin loan costs.
   * This wasn’t ideal because broker rates aren’t necessarily tied to the fed funds rate, so I added a **1% premium to better reflect real-world brokerage lending rates**.
   * With this adjustment, the **returns of margin investing and LETFs converged closely**.
3. **Key Takeaway: Competitive Margin Rates Make LETFs Less Appealing**
   * If a broker charges **1% above the fed funds rate**, leveraged investing with margin looks **almost identical** to LETFs in performance.
   * If the broker rate is **1.5%+ above the fed funds rate**, LETFs **become the better option** due to lower effective costs

[Traditional Leverage has similar returns to LETFs when competitive brokerage interest rate is used](https://preview.redd.it/9akjo4aaz1le1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=918976feffc51dcc6d7cdfe390b37697282f637a)



# Questions for the Community

1. **Is my methodology sound?** Am I missing any critical factors that would make LETFs behave differently from margin investing?
2. **How well does my margin cost assumption hold up?** What are realistic margin rates that retail traders actually get?
3. **Other risks I should consider?** I know LETFs have compounding decay, but in a strong uptrend, this isn’t as big of an issue.

Would love to get some feedback before I refine this further. Appreciate any critiques or suggestions!

1iwxu1v,Why do so many IRAs push 60% equity and 40% bonds?  Is a CD better than a bond?,"I've been sitting in cash waiting on this rumored correction and feel like it is coming.  But afterward I want to get into a balanced portfolio that I design and manage. I'm looking at bonds like LQD and JNK as well as TLT and other shorter treasuries and it seems to me that CDs and money markets pound bonds into the ground.  Why give up FDIC protection and no risk of principal to make less than bonds pay? I see yields of 0.5% a month which is lower than most money markets and bonds.  Maybe I just don't understand bonds but every time I've looked I come away thinking bonds are worthless, and I should put my money into CD ladders and money markets and not any in bonds, whether it is corp junk, corp investment grade, US treasuries, or any type of bond. So I'm considering 10% into Gold (GLD), 40% in CD ladders and the rest in a money market.  I'm 60 years old and given all that is wrong wiith me, I won't be alive in 20 years and 10 years isn't a likely thing either.  The bottom line is how can bonds be better when they pay less dividents than money markets or CDs, no matter what?  I lived in Ecuador and they paid 10% for a 1 year CD of at least $10,000.

1iwvsik,How to structure a set of trades that would allow someone to profit from the absolute relative divergence of two different companies share price?,"How can a set of trades be setup such that you profit when the price difference of two different companies diverges from one another?  Lets say Company A and Company B have a share price of $10, and for the sake of keeping this simple, and lets say premiums are $5 overall.  At a future date, you make a profit if:

* Company A went up and Company B went down.  For example, Company A went up to $15 and B went down to $5, you make $5.
* Company B went down and Company A went up.  For example, Company A went down to $8 and B went up $16, you make $1.



Now more complexly you make a profit if:

* Company A outperforms Company B and both went up.  For example, Company A went up to $25 and Company B went up $15, you would only make $5.
* Company B outperforms Company A and both went up.  For example, Company B up to $18 and Company A went up to $11, you would make $2.
* Company A stays flat and Company B went up.  For example, Company A stays at $10 and Company B went up to $20, you would make $5.



You lose money if they both move in tandem or do not move at all:

* Company A stays flat and Company B stay flat, meaning you lose your $5 premium.
* Company A rises a little and Company B drops a little.  For example, Company A goes up to $12 and Company B down to $9, you lose $2.
* Company A rises a lot and so does Company B the same amount.  For example, Company A goes up to $20 and Company B goes up to $20, you lose $5.
* Company A drops a lot and so does Company B the same amount.  For example, Company A goes up down to $2 and Company B down up to $3, you lose $4.

  
Now, what I know I can do is say if I think one will remain flat and the other one will either rise or lower, then I can take out a Long Butterfly Spread in one of the companies and a Short Butterfly Spread in the other, but what I cannot figure out is a way to do this symmetrically across both companies.

This is slightly possible to do if you already own shares in one company and you want to gain the amount of shares you have in that company.  You can sell your shares in a company and take out a Short Butterfly in the other company, then converting your profits back into the original company you sold, but this is not thinking in terms of cash.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1iwvsik/how_to_structure_a_set_of_trades_that_would_allow/,1740379265.0

ChatGPT said:
The market ticker moves based on the interaction of bid and ask (sell) prices in an order book. Here’s how it works:

Bid Price (Buyers' Offers) – This is the highest price that buyers are currently willing to pay for an asset. If a seller agrees to sell at this price, a trade happens.

Ask Price (Sellers' Offers) – This is the lowest price that sellers are willing to accept for an asset. If a buyer is willing to pay this price, a trade occurs.

Price Movement:

If buyers are aggressive and start placing higher bid prices, the stock or asset price moves up.
If sellers are aggressive and start placing lower ask prices, the price moves down.
If a large market order (instant buy or sell) clears existing bid or ask levels, the price can move significantly in either direction.
Market Orders vs. Limit Orders:

Market orders execute at the best available price, pushing the price up (for buys) or down (for sells).
Limit orders sit in the order book until matched, influencing the spread between bid and ask but not moving the price immediately.
Example:
A stock's bid price is £100, and the ask price is £101.
A buyer places a market buy order for 10 shares.
If the lowest available ask price is £101, the trade happens at £101, moving the ticker up.
If a seller aggressively sells at £99, it can push the ticker down.
In summary, the market price moves based on supply (sell orders) and demand (buy orders), with large or aggressive trades having the most impact.

1iwbvn0,UTMA Investment Plan | Feedback Request,"Hi! I’m not the most educated when it comes to investing but I’m trying to change that. I recently opened a UTMA through Schwab for my 1 year old and invested 11k. I also plan on contributing monthly a minimum of $80-$200 and investing it.

In effort to actually make this happen relatively quickly, the investing, I went to GPT a lot for guidance. I essentially prompted it to create a well rounded and balanced strategy that would enable the balance to grow over 100k by the time my child reaches 21. With the strategy it provided and assuming I stay the track with contributing, and of course the world doesn’t end/markets tank at the wrong time, this account should technically grow past 100k if not well over assuming the markets more or less follow the same trend over the next 20 years as I did the past 20.

I’d like feedback on the strategy it’s provided me. It made sense to me but I also never really invested any serious money in the market.

VTI - 22
VXUS - 35
QQQM - 5
VB - 2
BND - 7

1iwb6nb,Investing in Russia? Possible? Don’t debate the ethics.,"In investing the goal is to buy low. Few markets have been more depressed than Russia due to the (very well deserved) sanctions.

It appears Trump is going to cave to Russia and force Ukraine and the world to accept a bad deal, ending this war, and probably removing most international sanctions, particularly US sanctions. 

So, irrespective of your views of Russia (not here to debate the ethics of investing in an objectively horrible nation), how would one invest in Russian public companies? Every ETF I see appears to be liquidated, and I can’t see a clear way to invest in this market’s equities.

1iw7clb,"Turning 18 very soon, always planned to start investing - I’m now concerned due to Trump/ economy","Hi, I’m turning 18 very soon and am from the UK. I planned for years to start investing my own money pretty much as soon as I turned 18, but a couple of weeks ago my parents said they would give me access to my savings and could use that to invest/ put into a bank account etc. 

The amount was higher than I had expected and of course I’m really happy and it will be such a useful starting point for investment. I intend to top up the investment fund monthly with spare money which I get from my job. I plan on using Trading 212, and putting the majority of the money into the S&P 500, a bit into the FTSE, and a tiny amount into a few others (I have QQQ, VUAG and VUSA written down but I can barely remember what they are and will do more research). 

The problem is, I keep seeing in the news/online about how, due to many things but especially the election of Trump, the economy is in a bad place right now and the stock market is very volatile. I don’t mind if the ROI is below average, I just don’t want to lose any money - especially my savings, which has been saved up my whole life by my family and could mess up my future if I lose. Should I invest now or wait a bit? Thanks!

TLDR - I’m turning 18 and have got some money to invest, but am unsure due to state of economy/ stock market. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1iw7clb/turning_18_very_soon_always_planned_to_start/,1740306862.0

Seeing that there is a federal interest free program and $5000 provincial grant for Solar, we inquired about solar energy.

My biggest gains have come from NVDA and PLTR which were up over 900 & 600% until this past week.

I really feel we are on the cusp of a significant downturn in the market and the ecomomic outlook is negative and very uncertain.

What are everyone's thought about these next few weeks?  I think with the turmoil that the current adminstration is causing, its not going to bode well for the economy and the market.

1ivbhvr,Here is why stocks beat rentals,"Today I was visiting the different rentals I have and while in the car did a lot of analyzing rentals versus stocks. Since the topic comes up frequently I will give my thoughts. 

Example rental I have. $40k purchase price, $750/mo rent. This is a great deal by all metrics. This is essentially a 2% rule deal which is unheard of.

Taxes $100/mo, insurance $100/mo, maintenance $100/mo, lawn care and miscellaneous $100/mo. Anyone who knows Realestate knows $100 a month doesn’t really cover major capex but let’s go with it. 

Net is essentially $350/mo or about $4k a year on $40k. 10% not bad. I can probably increase rent 5% a year, the property will increase 5% a year. and let’s say I hold for 30 years. 

After 30 years I made give or take $200k in rent and the property is worth $165k. And my annual rent will be about $18k now. 


$40k in BTI stock right now would pay you $3,200 a year in dividends. If you reinvest all dividends for 30y, they increase dividends 5% and the share appreciates 3%…

My shares are worth $234k, I made a total of $155k in dividends, I’m receiving $24k annually from dividends. 

A few things not taken into consideration include the ability to use leverage which can increase returns but also increase risk, alternatively the work required to maintain a rental. No management fees have been included as well. 

Now take all this into consideration, the likelihood or effort of finding a 2% deal, the work required, the liquidity of both, and the fact that I didn’t account for major capex and you can clearly see which is the better option.

1iv16vq,Here’s why I don’t see the stock market tanking in the next 3-4 years (practical/behavioral reasons),"I don’t see it happening under this administration – and I’m a Moderate btw so I have no dog in a political fight.  This is not a political post but a behavioral one.  In his last administration, Trump bragged about things like “People’s 401K’s have never been higher” etc…and he was right to an extent.  But in fairness, my 401K and investments were also doing great under the previous administration as well.  So to the behavioral part: in service of his colossal ego only, Trump will not let the economy nor the markets fail.  I think things like tariffs are mostly grandstanding, and once he gets a real indication that they are becoming deleterious to companies and the market - and his constituents start barking about their investments, 401K’s, and prices of goods, he will pull back on such measures.  Of course, he will not admit he was wrong on these steps  – but rather spin it whereby he got what he wanted, i.e. ”I’m pulling back the tariff %’s because (X) country has made concessions to the U.S. to create a more balanced trading field,” etc… Quite simply, his ego is too fragile to let things go badly and he can’t stand the thought of failing – especially when he was so critical of the previous administration for things like inflation, etc.

Also Republicans (and Trump) are notorious De-regulators so I see companies eventually being mostly optimistic once we get out of this initial downturn.  Unfortunately, the Walmart’s of the world tend to temporarily drive market sentiment.  But I am not worried in the long-run once this initial period of bluster and uncertainty go away.

1iuyzsv,Thoughts on a unique situation?,"Let's say my wife (early 30's) has a bit of money in an inherited IRA from her father. Because it's an ""inherited"" account, she can draw from it without paying penalties, but it is not a Roth so she will have to pay normal income tax on any withdrawals. She also cannot make any further contributions to the account. 

Now, we are rather low earners. Around $60k/yr together so we don't even fill the 12% tax bracket. I was considering pros and cons to slowly moving some of this account into a brokerage account, or a Roth IRA if possible. Looking at the long term capital gains tax brackets, it's unlikely we would pay much, if any, tax on withdrawals from the brokerage account during retirement since the the 0% long term capital gains tax bracket reaches nearly $100k when filling joint. 

If we did this, we would pay taxes now on whatever we move so there's less money to grow, but less taxes paid later (leaving us with slightly more money according to some quick estimated calculations). However, if we decided for any reason to change up allocations, there would be tax implications at that time. We keep most of our portfolio in the S&P 500 and have no plans to change that anytime soon, but it's worth considering. 

If we leave it as is and just let it grow, we pay nothing now, but full income tax rates in retirement. It also allows us to buy and sell within the account, if we decided to do so, without tax implications.

I would love to hear everyone's thoughts on this. I find it to be an interesting situation. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1iuyzsv/thoughts_on_a_unique_situation/,1740165173.0

1iusau4,Revised Long-Term Leveraged ETF Strategy (200k€ Initial Investment),"Hello everyone! After analyzing various approaches and considering risk management, I'd like to share my refined investment strategy. This plan aims to balance leverage, growth potential, and portfolio stability over a 20+ year horizon.

Initial Portfolio Structure (200k€ Lumpsum)

* MIVU:FR (Amundi MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Factor UCITS): 35% (70k€) Core stability position providing lower volatility exposure to U.S. equities
* CL2:FR (Amundi 2x Leveraged MSCI USA UCITS ETF): 22.5% (45k€)
* LQQ:FR (Lyxor 2x Leveraged Nasdaq-100 UCITS ETF): 22.5% (45k€) Combined 45% in 2x leveraged ETFs for enhanced market exposure
* PE500:FR (Amundi S&P 500 UCITS ETF): 10% (20k€)
* PANX:FR (Amundi Nasdaq-100 UCITS ETF): 10% (20k€) Traditional ETFs for additional stability

Monthly Investment Plan & Leverage Strategy Starting with an initial portfolio leverage of 1.45x ((90k€ × 2 + 110k€) / 200k€), I'll be investing 1,500€/month exclusively into leveraged ETFs (split 50/50 between CL2 and LQQ). Through these monthly contributions, I aim to reach a target leverage of 1.6x in approximately 93 months (7.75 years). This approach relies entirely on fresh capital without selling any existing positions.

After the 93 months, I will exclusively invest in low-volatility S&P 500 or MSCI USA, depending on what is available at the time. If, by then, I have access to a 2x leveraged low-volatility ETF for the USA or even the world, I will allocate all my investments to that option.

Risk Management & Long-Term Approach The strategy maintains Min Vol as a permanent core (35%) to provide portfolio stability and reduce sequence risk. This, combined with the 20% allocation to non-leveraged ETFs, creates a strong foundation while still allowing for enhanced returns through leveraged exposure. The gradual increase in leverage through monthly contributions, rather than immediate reallocation, helps manage risk and reduce timing pressure.

Key Strategy Components:

* Initial leverage: 1.45x
* Target leverage: 1.6x (reached through monthly contributions)
* Timeline: \~93 months to reach target leverage
* Min Vol permanent allocation: 35%
* No selling of existing positions
* Pure contribution strategy: 1,500€/month to leveraged ETFs

Would love to hear your thoughts on this approach, particularly regarding:

1. The timeline to reach 1.6x leverage
2. The decision to maintain permanent Min Vol exposure
3. The monthly contribution strategy versus more aggressive reallocation
4. Do you think I should replace MSCI USA Minimum Volatility with NTSX ?

We are both in our mid 30s and simply trying to put away money. We're with Schwab.

My account first, wifes acct is second. Ignore the one-off weed stock, that is leftover from some silly stock picking and I am still scratching my head why the advisor didn't do something about it. There is a decent amount in our respective SWVXX which is part of our emergency fund.

Thanks for any input.

1iur2cv,Dividend ETF Comparison Question,"So I currently am putting most of my extra money that isn't going towards my retirement account into SCHD which is one of the more popular dividend ETFs. I see a lot of people talking about JEPQ. I looked into it and the expense ratio is like 5x higher than SCHD (I'm guessing because it's actively managed) but the dividend is also almost 3 times higher with a monthly pay out, not quarterly like SCHD. JEPQ is also a newer ETF being around for only about 2 years but has decent gains so far.

Wondering if the higher dividend is worth the higher expense ratio and if it is worth getting in early on a new ETF, I mean look at the long term trend of SCHD for example.

JEPQs goal is to generate current income and maintain prospects for capital appreciation. Wondering if an ETF like this is a good long term investment if its goal is current income?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1iur2cv/dividend_etf_comparison_question/,1740145029.0

1iupvke,Coming into some cash from parents - what would you do?,"If you were in this situation, what would you do?  

47 yoa - moved during the start of the last housing bubble so locked in 30 yr fixed 4.5 with 0.25% discount… essentially 4.25%.   Pay Off at 73 years of age.   Want to retire around 55.   

Parents want to give us $400,000 (200 each) to do with what we want.   I kidda don’t want to pay a mortgage until I’m 77 years old when I’m retiring at 55.   The 400,000 would be half of our current mortgage.  

I already have a 403b, and 457 that i was funding with hopes to use its tax free growth to pay off some mortgage when we retire.  Maxing Roth IRA for the last 15 years as well.

Would you:
1.  Make one big lump sum payment on house now and have the house paid off in 11 years (in time for retirement) 
2.  Buy government 10 year at 4.6%
3.  Invest in something with dividend
4.  Take 2 or 3 and use the divided or extra money paid to pay down mortgage as you go (should help pay 3 months per year at 4.5%)
5.  Other ideas?

Update:
Already have 1 year emergency fund and no debt other than mortgage… 4 kids who will most likely go to college but 529’s are funded pretty well for all 4.   I’m not sure why people downvoted my lack of risk tolerance for this money… very odd but ok.    Not sure if this changes things or people’s opinions but i did not think about the tax consequences of the 400 k.   

Option 6:   Due to taxes, i like the idea of a trust that someone suggested… maybe the 400k stays with my parents, they put it into a trust that pays out 18k to us per year and we just take the 18 k and put it to the mortgage.   The trust would have to make 4.5% to pay indefinitely, more to grow….

1iumr84,Carry trading in Turkey - what are the risks or disadvantages aside from currency risk?,"If relevant for tax reasons, I live in Germany. 

Let’s say I have €100.000. The most interest I can get here is 2.5%, meaning the monthly interest amount would be €208 minus 27% tax. 

And now the carry trade in Turkey scenario. I send the money to my bank account in TR. I pay a miniscule amount for the transfer. I convert the money to TRY. The spread is very high between buying and selling rates, around 5%. I have €95.000 now. The yearly interest rate for time deposit is 40%. Let’s just say, 10% for 3 months. I keep the money for that period, get an extra €9.500, pay the %15 tax and just piss off with my €8.075. 

I know there is currency risk. But TRY had been stable for the last 6 months now and there are reasons for the government to try to keep it stable for another few months. So, let’s just say I believe the currency will be stable during this period and the risk, I’m willing to take.

1iukcg0,Testing stock picking services with paper trading,"This is something I've done occasionally since starting in 2013 and I was surprised how bad they all are, not that I expected them to beat the market or anything, but still, it's like they try to lose money. I am also impressed with how they fake the data to make it seem like historically they're in a huge plus while every time I start looking is just the moment they suddenly start losing.

Well, we had quite a good run up to yesterday so I'll make a cut there since the vast majority of the stocks fell. This was not scientific at all, it's an average of 16 transactions per each name and I just bought everything they like and sold if they said so.

The names are just the first random stuff I could gather on investing subreddits.

Paul Thomas Investing - down 7.5 %. These are usually just stocks in freefall, I reckon they down 75% when I glance back but I had a 7% stop loss so they stopped at 7.5 haha

WallStreetZen - down 3.75 %

Zacks Ultimate (was on trial for cheap) - down 2.36 %  
Just gathering info from the articles rather than following investors seems to net much better results and is slightly in the plus.

AfterHour - down 2.07 %. Would be down way more if I didn't choose and pick hard what people and advice to follow. Got a 25% win with PLTR (smth I actually bought with real money), so I guess that's something.

Prospero ai - down 1.64 %

My weekly stock - down 1.30 %

Seeking alpha - down 0.43 % - almost not losing money at this point, impressive!  


Next step, testing in a bear market. I mean, I'm not gonna do it, but I have a feeling it does not look pretty.

1iu02ca,Can someone help me understand capital gains for actively managed ETFs in taxable accounts?,"Let's take an extreme example with a fund like ADPV. My understanding is that it screens for growth & momentum, cycling between about 25 companies of all market capitalization sizes and US treasuries. I don't know what the turnover is like, but part of the prospectus says it's designed to prevent large drawdowns, so it seems that there is a fair deal of trading going on within the fund.

How exactly does capital gains work for this? Let's assume I'm dollar cost averaging into the fund (in a taxable brokerage) & not selling, but the fund managers are selling once momentum trends change. Do I receive a schedule D form at the end of the fiscal year from the broker with all the S.T. capital gains liabilities? If so, is the principal the same with passive funds that track indices when a given company no longer meets the criteria to be held by the fund?

1ittwsw,PLTR to $20 by March? Insider Sell Window Theory,"PLTR’s sitting pretty at $100+ right now, with a 40x revenue multiple and 150x forward earnings—absolute madness. But I’ve got a wild theory I’m chewing on, and I want your take. The tea leaves (X posts, earnings vibes, random chatter) suggest the board’s pumping the stock hard—like, artificially keeping it sky-high—to set up a sweet exit window for insiders and employees. Then, bam, they let it drop once the selling’s done.Here’s the kicker: Karp’s unloading 9.975M shares through Sept 2025 (SEC filings), and the next trading window’s mid-Feb to mid-April after earnings. Stock’s got hype, but this valuation’s a house of cards—feels like they’re nudging folks to cash out now before gravity hits. I’m calling it: if they ease off the juice post-window, PLTR could crater to $20 by March 2025. That’s, what, 20x forward earnings, closer to sanity for a software play, even with their AI glow.Am I nuts? Sell with the insiders in Feb-April while it’s $100+, or is this just FUD and PLTR holds the line? Could it really hit $20 that fast if the board stops propping it up?

Looks like my HSA has not been reinvesting dividends from me being in VTI but has been from Fidelity Government Cash Reserves, which I assume is my cash fund in the account. 

This is from an account that is years old so these contributions were from a while back and my contributions for this year are completed already. I am fine to simply buy more VTI with the dividends that have built up in my cash account at this time and then change my preferences in the future so that VTI does self reinvest, correct? No issues buying more stock with that money if I already bought my yearly allowance, since the I'm not trying to deposit additional money and instead moving money around within the HSA itself, right?

So many times I hear how risky they are, which i do agree, they are. 

But what I dont understand is that if one wants to short a particular stock what is the big deal if they sell a naked call option and collect a premium while doing so?


For example. 

If i want to sell a naked call option on NVDA at say 100 expiring next week and collect a premium of $500 while doing so and the stock jumps to $115 and i am assigned. Well now I'm assigned at $100 a share along with $500 in premium i collected, so in reality my cost basis if I include the $500 is $105 but it's now trading at 115. So I'm down a $1000

Now if i hold onto that short and wait it out because I'm still believing it's going to drop and it does drop it's a win win....

Napkin math says with an 8.5% annual average return I’d have $5.3 million by 2065. What will the value of $5.3 million be in the year 2065? I’m having trouble gauging it. I think an accurate way to assess it may be to look back 40 years from today and find what that dollar amount was then to find a multiplier.

I’m not sure that just looking at the US governments inflation numbers would be accurate. For instance I think if you ran the numbers 40 years ago and multiplied by the inflation rate every year I don’t think you’d have enough in todays money. 

$250k in 1985 is $750k in 2025

1985 $250k - enough to retire back then

Perhaps the main example is the SP500, which gets a lot of investment regardless of the performance of the companies.



If we assume that this trend will continue, meaning that more people will invest in the stock market, and that a significant part will blindly invest on a given index (let's say SP500): does it mean that SP500 is more likely to outperform other stock groups in the future?



Clarification: I am not referring to the impact in individual stocks of being included or removed from a given index. I am referring to the performance of the index as a whole.

1iswfut,Advice for investing in bonds and possibly CDs. Is now a good time?,"So far, I've invested exclusively in stocks. My portfolio is pretty diverse because of the mutual funds that I have bought into, but I'm wondering if I should consider diversifying a bit more and looking into fixed-income securities.

Is now a good time to buy bonds, whether corporate or treasury? Interest rates have been going up in order to combat inflation, haven't they? The interest rates that I can find on US treasury bonds put them in the mid-4% range, depending on when they mature. That looks like the highest we have seen since before 2008. Is that a ""good"" rate relative to future inflation?

Or should I look into corporate bonds with good credit ratings? I can find rates around 5% for the longest term purchases. Would the higher rate of return be worth the increased potential risk?

Also, there are some basic things that I still don't fully understand about bonds. If I buy them now, am I guaranteed to lock in that rate until the term expires, even in the event of a future rate cut?

And how does collecting on the interest work? If I buy $10,000 worth of 30-year bonds at a 5% rate, does that mean that I would get $500 every 6 months for 30 years, plus the promise of getting the initial ten grand back at the end? And is a dividend rate like that worth the opportunity cost of keeping that money in stocks?

My stock investments have done quite well over the last few years, and so I figured that it might be nice to ""store"" some of those capital gains to have them generate some passive income, as well as to have a small hedge against future downturns. But on the other hand, my investment horizon will last for decades, so I can afford to weather some of those downturns.

Also, what about CDs? How do they differ from bonds, and should I consider buying into those instead of/in addition to bonds? What would you all do in my position?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1iswfut/advice_for_investing_in_bonds_and_possibly_cds_is/,1739937631.0

1isv6xb,"Intel: TSMC & Broadcom Eye Key Assets, but Regulatory Hurdles Loom","* Intel is in early discussions with TSMC and Broadcom for a potential joint venture or acquisition.
* TSMC is exploring control over Intel’s Foundry business but requires U.S. regulatory approval.
* Broadcom is interested in Intel’s design assets, aligning with its growth strategy.
* Intel’s stock surged 24% last week but remains uncertain due to regulatory and deal structure risks.
* CHIPS Act restrictions require Intel to maintain key control over its Foundry business if spun off.
* Intel has $50.7 billion in debt, and a deal could help reduce financial strain.
* Intel is in early discussions with TSMC and Broadcom for a potential joint venture or acquisition.
* TSMC is exploring control over Intel’s Foundry business but requires U.S. regulatory approval.

Intel has been at the center of takeover speculation, with reports suggesting Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and Broadcom (AVGO) are looking to acquire parts of the company. These discussions, still in the early stages, could result in a joint venture or asset sale that restructures Intel’s operations.

TSMC, which previously distanced itself from Intel, is now exploring a joint venture for Intel’s Foundry business. The feasibility study focuses on acquiring Intel’s chip plants, particularly its 18A process node and proprietary PowerVia technology. However, such a deal would require U.S. government approval. Reports suggest that the Trump administration supports the move, with Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick involved in the discussions. If finalized, TSMC might lead a consortium of investors, including private equity firms and semiconductor companies, to structure the acquisition.

Broadcom has reentered the picture with an interest in Intel’s design assets. CEO Hock Tan is known for streamlining businesses after acquisitions, and he could reshape Intel’s design segment, likely keeping Data Center & AI assets while selling off other divisions. If Broadcom proceeds, a possible scenario could involve selling Intel’s Client design business to a company like Qualcomm. This would be similar to Broadcom’s strategy after acquiring VMware, where it divested non-core business units to focus on profitability.

Intel’s stock jumped 24% last week, marking its best weekly performance in over two decades. The company is currently valued at around $102.19 billion, trading close to its book value. However, despite the market optimism, there are risks that could derail these deals. Regulatory approval remains a major hurdle, and CHIPS Act restrictions require Intel to retain key control over any spun-off Foundry assets. If negotiations fail or the government shifts its stance, Intel’s stock could face downward pressure.

For now, the uncertainty surrounding these takeover discussions keeps Intel at a Hold rating. While a deal could unlock significant value, the complexity of regulatory approvals and deal structures makes it difficult to predict an outcome. Investors should remain cautious as discussions progress.

# TL;DR:

Intel is in takeover talks with TSMC and Broadcom, but regulatory and strategic hurdles make the outcome uncertain. Stock surged 24%, but risks remain, keeping it at a Hold rating.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1isv6xb/intel_tsmc_broadcom_eye_key_assets_but_regulatory/,1739933843.0
1isuz90,"Should I Use Bank of America’s CD to Hit Platinum Rewards, or Invest Elsewhere?","I’m hoping to get some advice on a decision I’m facing. I have $40k to invest, and my main goal is to keep risk at (basically) zero.

Here’s the situation:

I currently have a Bank of America credit card with 1.8% unlimited cashback. If I maintain $50k in qualified Bank of America/Merrill accounts, I can upgrade to Platinum Honors and get 2.3% cashback on my card (plus some perks like waived fees, better rates, etc.). They’re offering a 7-month CD at 3.7% APY. If I park my $40k there, I’ll be able to reach $50k total for Platinum Honors. Or I could invest the $40k elsewhere and lose the Platinum Honors tier for my card and stay at 1.8% cashback.

**My questions:**

1. Has anyone here navigated BoA’s Platinum Honors program? How beneficial do you find that the program is?
2. Is it worth it to take a slightly lower rate on a BoA CD (3.7% for 7 months) just to maintain Platinum Honors status, given the 2.3% cashback benefits? And does anyone have any other no/low-risk investment ideas that might beat BoA’s 3.7% CD over 7 months, factoring in the potential gain of the extra 0.5% on my credit card spending?

I’m definitely leaning towards locking in the CD at BoA for peace of mind and to get the Platinum status, but I don’t want to overlook alternatives that might be a better opportunity.

1iss92u,Reliability of economic metrics,"I would say that a basic underpinning of healthy financial markets is reliable data. For instance, the measurement of inflation is based on accurate reporting of prices and interest rates. Jobs numbers are also an important gauge of ""how we are doing."" Is unemployment high or low? How did it move since the last time we measured it? Inflation and unemployment are both measured and reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

What happens to financial markets when those core metrics are incorrect? What happens if they're deliberately falsified to manipulate markets or to create a false narrative of economic success? Has it ever happened before? I'm concerned that we could be heading into challenging economic times but for political reasons, those numbers might be hidden on order of the executive branch.

1ispiy1,Is the Federal Reserve risking a policy error by underestimating inflation?,"By policy error, I don't mean anything as egregious as 2021, where rates were kept at zero as inflation ran up to 7%+. Instead, the likely outcomes are

1. inflation getting permanently ""stuck"" around 3%, as we enter a 5th consecutive year of 3%+ inflation
2. a 1990s-style asset bubble / parabolic melt-up, especially on anything AI-adjacent

It's clear inflation is not under control. Since May 2024, trailing-12-month core CPI has been perpetually stuck in the 3.1-3.2% range, and core PCE around 2.7-2.8%. (Chart: [https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-STOCKS/klvyqxrrqvg/inflation.png](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-STOCKS/klvyqxrrqvg/inflation.png) )

In my humble opinion, it's also apparent that current interest rates are NOT restrictive in any shape or form. The federal funds rate has been at or above 4% since December 2022, with no noticeable long-term damage to any part of the economy (except OFFICE commercial real estate, for structural reasons unrelated to rates.)

Why is it that Federal Reserve officials

a) have effectively taken rate INCREASES off the table, instead believing that simply holding rates would be enough?

b) continue to yap about (eventual) rate cuts - they're just postponed for the time being, not canceled? (Just watch Waller & Goolsbee interviews - they're ""on hold for now but still expect rate cuts later"")

c) continue to believe the ""neutral"" rate is at rock-bottom pre-COVID levels? (December 2024's SEP showed half of the FOMC still thought the ideal long-run rate was in the 2's)

(The above started long before last November's election, so I don't believe their dovish rate-cutting bias is politically driven. Powell was talking about cutting rates in December 2023.)

I don't have an Economics PhD but have been investing & following central bank policy decisions for quite some time. To me, this seems like the most recklessly dovish  FOMC, relative to economic & financial conditions, since Arthur Burns. Am I missing something?
