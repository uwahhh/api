Jerome Powell faces a tricky task this week of both assuring investors the economy remains on solid footing while also conveying policymakers stand ready to step in if necessary.

Even as the Federal Reserve chair has touted US resilience, uneasiness sparked by President Donald Trump’s rapidly escalating trade war has sent stocks tumbling over the past month. Bond yields are down, too, as is consumer sentiment as worries about the economic outlook mount.

“Powell needs to give some sort of a signal that they’re watching it,” said Dominic Konstam, head of macro strategy at Mizuho Securities USA. While the Fed chief will likely make it clear that officials don’t target the stock market, they can’t ignore the recent slide, he warned.

The Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates steady when they meet March 18-19, but traders now see high odds of three rate cuts this year, most likely beginning in June. Economists generally expect two reductions, similar to what forecasters foresee policymakers’ updated projections to show Wednesday. 

Some investors caution that if officials continue to signal only two reductions in 2025, it becomes all the more important for the Fed chief to emphasize the central bank’s willingness to adjust borrowing costs if the labor market stumbles. 

“At the margin, the Fed could make it slightly better or slightly worse,” said James Athey, a portfolio manager at Marlborough Investment Management. “But clearly they can’t completely calm markets because the hit to sentiment has come largely from the White House.” 

On top of the escalating and ever-changing tariff threats toward America’s largest trading partners, the Trump administration hasn’t done much to downplay recession risks. The president said March 9 that the US economy faces a “period of transition,” and his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted the US and markets are in need of a “detox.” ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jcvlcn/the_fed_is_in_waitandsee_mode_investors_want/,1742158769.0

1jcmp9j,What happened to Ulta and should you look at it now?,"Seeing Ulta’s stock movement and wondering what’s happening? Here’s a breakdown of how the company has evolved since COVID and what challenges/opportunities lie ahead.

# Pre-COVID (2016-2019): Strong Growth, but Slowing Momentum

* Looking at the 2016-2019 period the company had grown tremendously its store base getting to over 1,000 stores in the US, a doubling of footprint in five years. As a result, comparable sales (sales made only in stores already opened the previous years) were starting to normalize as incremental stores were generating less footfall and the ramp-up of opened stores was getting close to their optimal productivity. Ulta was on the way to maturing gracefully.

# COVID Bust & Boom: The Unexpected Turn

* COVID-19 triggered a wave of “boom and bust” scenarios across various industries. Companies like ZoomInfo and Domino's Pizza experienced significant sales increases during the pandemic, only to face normalization as the lock-downs ended. In contrast, Ulta went through the opposite trend: a bust followed by a boom, alongside sectors like hotels and spirits. Initially, the pandemic posed an existential threat to retailers like Ulta when no one could shop in stops anymore. However, as consumers found themselves with extra disposable income and a higher focus on self-care, Ulta capitalized on this shift, including through their relaunched e-commerce platform, leading to a remarkable rebound in comparable sales that surpassed pre-COVID levels.

# Normalization & The Sephora@Kohl’s Threat

* Under normal circumstances, we would have expected comparable sales to come down with a few weak quarters and then return to mid-to-high-single-digit industry growth post-COVID. However, in 2021, Sephora, the high-end beauty retailer owned by LVMH, launched an aggressive expansion by opening stores within Kohl’s stores, similar to Ulta's partnership with Target. Historically, Sephora had limited U.S. locations, primarily in city centers and airports. By leveraging Kohl’s locations, they targeted the same customer base as Ulta, attracting shoppers drawn to Sephora's ""prestige"" image despite an overall very similar product offering. Over the course of 3 years, Sephora opened 1,000 stores which are generating USD 1.8bn of revenue in 2024. Ulta admitted that 90% of their own stores had been impacted by new competitors' openings and that they had lost market shares.n.

# So, Is Ulta a Buy?

✅ **Positives:**

* Ulta has an impressive history of growth, disciplined capital allocation, generous returns to shareholders and very little debt (0.7x ND/EBITDA 2024). They are participating in one of my favorite categories: Beauty, which has a track record of sustainably growing mid single digit p.a. globally (see bonus chart at the end) and they have a strong brand, impressive loyalty program, and great store locations.

❌ **Concerns:**

* On the other hand, it is an asset-heavy business with limited scalability once stores reach optimum productivity, challenges in the online channel, and no significant international growth to date (Mexico is not yet live). They are being challenged by a very strong franchise with Sephora@Kohl’s, backed by deep-pocketed LVMH. In online they also face Amazon developing brand shops in prestige beauty with Estée Lauder.

# Valuation & Takeaway

* If consensus estimates hold with growth over +4% p.a. N3Y and end EBIT margin at 12.2%, with multiple remaining at 16x P/E NTM returns would be well in excess of 10% p.a. However, if growth remains weak on the back of Sephora (still targeting +11% growth in 2025 according to Kohl's reporting) and margins fail to expand beyond 12%, then its goes down.

There, I made an argument why markets were overpriced due to valuations and the actions of the current administration.

I am still worried, and I'm wondering what are the counter-arguments. 

1. Valuations are still high. 
2. Trump admin and Musk are pushing austerity via spending cuts/mass layoffs. 
3. Unstable tariff policy. Companies and consumers can't plan ahead. April 2 is coming. More chaos or clarity?
4. Soft data has been terrible. 
5. High-frequency and corporate data (travel, retail) all point to a rapidly deteriorating consumer. 

All of that makes me worried we are headed for a recession. Banks seem to agree and have upped their forecasts for one. Three months ago this would have been laughable. 

Granted, this can all change on a tweet. The trump team can pivot, make tariffs more clear & targeted, and Doge can become more work and less theater. Then, we can get to beneficial tax policies & deregulation.

I'm concerned that's not gonna happen. 

I'm concerned that Trump tariffs wont make companies move to the US & create jobs as Trump, Lutnick, and Bessent think they will. I'm concerned that people will get fired and become more poor, things will get more expensive, and Trump team will have nothing to show for it. 


Now, to positioning & stocks:

I've been buying things that will benefit from protectionist policies, like INTC and X. I've also bought the dip on several big tech names & then sold them on Friday after the rally. Why? Take Nvidia, for example. Great company, but if chips aren't excluded from tariffs, then Nvidia's profit margins would get slashed. So would the valuation.

I'm sitting on a lump of cash & am waiting for more clarity, whether it's up or down.

Why? Let’s break it down:

Market selloffs act as a cleansing mechanism, forcing weak hands and overleveraged traders to liquidate. As panic peaks—what traders call capitulation—patient, strategic investors step in to seize discounted opportunities.

Right now, we’re in one of those moments, just as a massive Fed meeting kicks off this upcoming Wednesday. The market has been in a three-week freefall. Part of that is now being shown to be attributed to over leveraged hedge funds getting wiped out in crowded positions. 
Could their timing be any worse? I’ve never seen hedge funds (and CTAs apparently) get steam rolled like that! 

I thought they were the smart money? All the while, the following items just happened: 

✅ The largest spending bill in U.S. history was just announced.
✅ Inflation is finally stabilizing.
✅ Interest rates are near 52-week lows.
✅ Deregulation is sweeping through multiple industries reducing legal costs and overhead 
✅ Tax cuts are now on their way to being passed including no tax on tips, no tax on over time, etc etc

1jc36c5,Tesla stock declines could cost Elon Musk something important,"Snippet from this article:”After a slight rebound earlier this week, Tesla's TSLA stock is back to falling, keeping with its recent performance. Even U.S. President Donald Trump's purchase of one hasn’t done much to spark real momentum for the electric vehicle (EV) leader.
After enjoying significant growth throughout the final months of 2024 and through early 2025, TSLA has lost its previous momentum and isn’t showing signs of a rebound. As reports of declining sales and shifting consumer sentiment continue to trend, it's hard to ignore the company’s questionable outlook.

Link: https://www.thestreet.com/technology/tesla-stock-declines-could-cost-elon-musk-something-important

Many of these problems can be traced to CEO Elon Musk, who is preoccupied with his new responsibilities at the Department of Government Efficiency. His absence at Tesla’s manufacturing facilities is being felt as share prices continue to trend downward.
Musk has lost a lot of money as TSLA stock falls, but he could end up losing something else.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk may be in for a difficult decision if TSLA stock keeps declining. 

Musk’s intertwined business empire could be in trouble 
Tesla may be the company for which Musk is best known, but his assets include several other prominent tech names, including SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter). This wide array of responsibilities concerned investors long before he accepted his new position at DOGE.
Now that he has this new position, Musk is spending even less time running his companies, and things haven’t been going well for any of them. While Tesla stock fell last week, a SpaceX rocket exploded during a test flight, and a cyberattack took X down, although users regained access fairly quickly.

Tesla Bull sounds the alarm on Elon Musk’s leadership

This week, reports surfaced that TSLA stock’s poor performance has resulted in significant losses for Musk. On Monday, March 10, he lost roughly $4.7 billion for every $10 the stock price declined, amounting to a total loss of $18.8 billion.

1jc0zhg,Why $RDDT Is A Must Have Stock,"Reddit is one of the premier social media apps out there with a cheap valuation (never judge a growth stock by P/E) for its growth trajectory.

Let's start with the fundamentals:

1. 2024 YE it had a 90.5% gross profit percentage, revenue grew by 62% (NVIDIA like growth??) and it became FCF positive. Next quarter revenue will be growing at 50% to ultimately end at 40% YoY based on guidance. I've been following $RDDT for quite some time and there is always a beat on revenue AND guidance versus what they expected so you can say there is a little bit of conservatism in this numbers.
2. From a balance sheet perspective it only has $26.7mm of debt. This company generated $215mm in FCF this year and is forecast to double to $520mm by next year. Capex spend is only 2% of its revenue. This companies management loves to run things efficiently and as cheaply as possible. On going concern is not an issue.
3. The company is already EPS positive and will turn EPS positive on a YoY basis by 2025 YE. If you look at it from a PEG perspective, it is trading at 0.74 for 2026. Anything below 1 is cheap. The only reason you see negative EPS is because the company has been expensing stock based compensation (US GAAP) requirement each quarter. This has ended in 2024, that is why you see major acceleration in EPS growth QoQ moving forward.
4. Share dilution is very minimal. A lot of growth companies like to pay employees in stock to attract talent, but that is not what reddit does. Diluated shares outstanding actually fell 1% in QoQ. This is great for any share holder.
5. Reddit data is a gold mine. Google pays Reddit $66mm a year for data licensing. This has 85% operating margin - so you need to remember Reddits profitability isn't going away anytime soon because you are starting from a high point.
6. Insider trading has popped up this weekend after the crazy drop. That is a significant buy signal.
7. From a multiple standpoint, price to sales, revenue etc it has gotten cheaper despite the stock increasing in value. Reddit user growth has exploded over time, with 50% international base and is becoming a hit globally. Reddit's top 15 advertisers spent 50% more YoY and international ad revenue grew by 77%.

\- THIS IS IMPORTANT. If US were to go slow down, the international piece provides a buffer on revenue for the company.

8) Advertising approach is incredibly unique. Reddit offers companies the ability to have AMAs to offer product information. I've personally seen this in my time using this reddit. Each subreddit is highly specialized which makes advertising that much easier. People pay Meta and Google top dollar because they are able to use statistical AI inference to generate ad campaigns well. Reddit doesn't need that. If you sell bikes, there's a laundry list of bike subreddits you can target. This is the future as Ad targeting improves on Reddit.

Downside / Bear bases:

1. Highly dependent on Google search. Google search was the reason that Reddit fell after earnings because of the average daily user count fell. Management has said this happens often in its existence and they worked quickly to get back on top of user searches. Management was largely dismissive of this because of their experience and noted higher levels of people asking questions and typing reddit at the end into google.
2. AI Capex slows down. This will erode profitability on the company, but given how ""clean"" reddit data is, this is the least of my concerns.
3. Execution and ad platform growth. Growing is expensive, and if Reddit adopts a spend what you can to get it done it will have investors fearful. Based on their CFO's commentary this is not very likely because how they approach things and history shows.
4. User growth slows down. This is highly possible, but I do believe the international side of things will be a buffer on user growth.

Having said all of this, my PT is $250 for the company. This is an absolute long term hold.

Any dips should be bought and even though Reddit looks expensive at face value, it really isn't. It trades at 50x forward earnings with 50% YoY growth and a net profitability that will approach 30+%.

1jc0qst,RDDT: Longterm vulnerability due to moderation policies/procedures,"Despite a successful IPO, RDDT would appear to have a serious vulnerability due to moderation policies and procedures. As an investor, the question arises how much growth is possible for a company that relies so heavily on volunteer labor that is not closely monitored. Via moderation the platform in some instances becomes a ""publisher"", which removes legal protections for the site's content.

The issue is not so much weird and arbitrary moderation which users unfortunately encounter a bit too often (not on this sub...) but rather types of moderation that create legal vulnerabilities for the company. As we know RDDT is protected by Section 230 from user generated content. However, when user generated content is shaped by RDDT the nature of these protections change. Here is a hypothetical example (but one that reflects things that actually occur on the site);

Let's say a user promotes a false rumor about Taylor Swift--for example that part of her song writing process is getting in the zone by abusing pregnant, disabled puppies. As a post the only person with legal vulnerability is the user, even if the moderator/site passively fails to remove it.

On the other hand, let's say other users who see this false rumor and aim to disprove it are disciplined by the moderators (who share the first users hate of Taylor Swift)--for instance, issuing bans to users who challenge the original user or present contradictory information. At that point the role of RDDT and its moderators is no longer passive but is taking active steps to promote a false rumor against Ms. Swift. That moderator becomes legally liable in the same way as the original poster was.

(Note: This stuff really happens....)

Finally, if RDDT is negligent in preventing moderators from actively promoting false narratives (whether in a specific instance or not taking due care to prevent this occurrence, for instance via more robust site wide policies) RDDT also assumes liability.

Does this affect the longterm outlook for investors in RDDT?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jc0qst/rddt_longterm_vulnerability_due_to_moderation/,1742060849.0

1jbwju1,$TTD - A Buying Opportunity in its Plummeting Stock,"Trade Desk ($TTD) is down over 50% in literally a month, marking its largest decline in history after missing earnings for the first time. The stock sold off hard, but the fundamentals haven’t changed nearly as much as the price suggests. Analysts still have a median price target of ~$120, implying significant upside from here. I’m planning on buying LEAPS to take advantage of what looks like an overreaction.

Pros:

✅ Strong revenue growth – Still growing 23% YoY, despite ad spending softness
✅ High margins – 84% gross margins, which is best-in-class for ad tech
✅ Solid balance sheet – $1.5B in cash and no debt, giving them flexibility
✅ CTV dominance – Continued leadership in connected TV (CTV) advertising

Cons:

❌ Near-term ad spend weakness – Advertisers are cutting budgets in a tough macro environment
❌ Competitive pressures – Google and Amazon are pushing harder into programmatic advertising
❌ High valuation (even after the drop) – Still trades at 15-16x forward sales, though historically it’s commanded a premium

The long-term growth story for TTD remains intact, even if Q1 guidance disappointed. The market has punished it heavily, but historically, high-quality growth stocks tend to bounce back once macro pressures ease.

1jbv5dh,The Mar-A-Lago Accord - they are crashing the market AND the dollar,"So I've posted around this paper by Stephen Miran, ringing the alarm bells regarding what they are trying to do: [https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199\_A\_Users\_Guide\_to\_Restructuring\_the\_Global\_Trading\_System.pdf](https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199_A_Users_Guide_to_Restructuring_the_Global_Trading_System.pdf)

He is Trump's new chief economic adviser. Guess what? The word ""tariff"" appears here 215 times. This is the plan. This paper establishes a regime where America is literally a global protection racket - ""pay up the tariffs or we throw you to the wolves.""

This has a tinfoil hat flavor to all this, but just yesterday Ezra Klein's new episode dropped with Gillian Tett, a Financial Times reporter, and it is ALL about the Mar-A-Lago Accord. It's not a name of some conspiracy theory. This policy paper mentions ""Mar-A-Lago Accord"" as a thing: [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-gillian-tett.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-gillian-tett.html)

You are not crazy - they tried to impose tariffs on our allies, the allies balked, and now the crew is salty and disorganized. They don't know what to do. Hilariously, Miran predicted this himself (this is in the summary, p.37, read it):

>These policies may supercharge efforts of those looking to minimize exposure to the United States. Efforts to find alternatives to the dollar and dollar assets will intensify. There remain significant structural challenges with internationalizing the renminbi or inventing any sort of “BRICS currency,” so any such efforts will likely continue to fail, but alternative reserve assets like gold or cryptocurrencies will likely benefit.

Dionysis Partsinevelos at MSN breaks down the plan in a more terrifying detail, describing scenarios such as repricing Fort Knox gold (THAT'S why you've heard about it) and basically sabotaging the dollar and US bonds:

1jbu385,"It’s time for the pain rally to begin soon, and many retail investors who panic sold will be upset.","The short term bottom is in, and the market will rally and climb the wall of worry. It may not be to ATH but market will recover much of its losses.

This will be INCREDIBLY frustrating for so many redditors who panic sold and/ or went short.

Look at the peak Redditor sentiment— so much bearishness!! Inverse it and you will do very well.

You will read so many reddit comments that reflect their anger and disbelief that the market is suddenly ignoring tariff tweets— the market has now priced much of it in and market will believe that the uncertainty is largely over before April 2.

Remember COVID, the bottom was in around March 20. And redditors could not believe it even past April!!

So many redditors think the bottom will not occur until AFTER april 2 and they are wrong. Market is forward looking and will have discounted tariffs before then.

Look at this headline that dropped yesterday afternoon: New Canada PM Carney Says There’s Progress in US Trade Talks https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/carney-sworn-in-as-canada-leader-with-trade-dominating-agenda?embedded-checkout=true

Many redditors will FOMO back in next month or in May/June—they will lock in their previous losses —-just in time for the market to tank even harder! probably in Q3 when a real recession is here, and they panic again.

Just keep in mind the contrarian bearish AAII readings for 3 weeks in a row (it was as bad as 2009 GFC, it signaled a bottom in 2009) and SP500 Rsi at 30 and positive seasonality kicking in next week and positive vanna/charm March opex - all culminate into a rally of disbelief coming to destroy redditors’ sanity. 

Some data below:

INVESTOR SENTIMENT
AAII Bull/Bear Sentiment survey shows bearish sentiment at 60%, the highest level since recording 70% during 2008 financial crisis - reading this extreme show that 12 month later gains of 13.6%. This is the first time that bullish sentiment has been below 20% for three straight weeks. Bullish sentiment was last lower on September 22, 2022 (17.7%). 

Yesterday’s rally was a 90% upside breadth day. The last 90% day was 8/8/2024 - three days after the 8/5/2024 correction low.

VIX plunged 11% to 21 yesterday.

This was the 5th fastest correction in history. ALL previous rapid corrections found $SPX higher 3, 6, and 12 months forward. 

POSITIVE SEASONALITY INCOMING
$SPX seasonality roadmap would suggest we just bottomed into March OPEX, typically we see seasonal strength from late March and early April with a stronger June/July

1jbrhrp,The situation around European Defense Stocks,"I’m currently invested in American Defense Stocks (mostly Palantir) and a bunch of different European Defense Stocks. I got in a little late and only invested a few days ago.

I do believe the rally is not over yet. So far, I agree that it’s been pure speculation and Europe still has to pay up. However, I think we’re seeing a major cultural shift in Europe around defense. Trump said that if the EU doesn’t pay up, the US will completely remove all military funding to them. This obviously means Europe will have to pay to a certain extent. The question is, how much are they willing to pay up?

Let’s look at the situation right now. Ukraine is not done fighting yet and even if the US tries to help them get a ceasefire, so far the ceasefires conditions have not been accepted by Ukraine. Russia knows that the US under Trump will try to help negotiate more favourable conditions for them, which Ukraine will never agree to. So right now I don’t think the war is over yet. So that’ll definitely be more immediate spending by Europe on defense companies.

Even if we do somehow get a ceasefire within the next couple of weeks, the global environment has changed significantly. America does not want to send as much money overseas as it used to, and is moving more towards its original isolationist policies that were around before WW2. As china continues to scale up its military, it will continue to empower Russia to use as a buffer against the United States, and also get more favourable trades from them (oil, minerals etc.)

So without America, Europe will have to rely on itself. I don’t know how much Europe will be willing to spend on its military, but they are smart enough to know that the past 2 world wars happened on European soil and if they do not want a repeat of that, they can’t rely on anybody but themselves. No UN charter or rules or international law can save them when a countries more militarily armed than them decide to ignore the rules. 


So right now I’m just wondering how much do you guys think the EU will be willing to spend, at least over the next 4 years. How much of their budget do you think will be increased towards military spending. I know they’ve already increased it, but how much further are they willing to spend. 


Most people say Europe won’t spend much because of its culture around war. But keep in mind that that culture has only developed in the last 70 years. Before that Europe was a bloody place that had been fighting with each other for centuries. They know that if another war happens, even if it involves new powers from Asia, the European continent will not be spared. Another war or even the thought of it may actually break Europe. They spent the better part of the last century changing their culture around racial integration and rebuilding their economy from the rubbles. That culture was made for the sole purpose to avoid another war from ever happening. We like to think of the UN, WTO, WHO and all these international councils as to bring the world together, but their original purpose was to have better mutual cooperation and understanding in the west to prevent another war. 

Europe did everything except improve their military. I’d assume that was to prevent empowering threats from within Europe. Now that threats are coming out of Europe, they may have to start re-thinking their global outlook and strategy.

So these European Defense stock rallies could be the beginning of massive gains in the coming months and years.

1jbcflu,S&P 500 Stages Rebound After $5 Trillion Plunge: Markets Wrap,">A bounce in stocks calmed nerves among equity investors, but the fallout from Donald Trump’s political maneuvering continued to shake global markets and rattle US consumers. Yields on German bonds surged as government leaders agreed on a massive defense spending package, while the ultimate haven asset — gold — topped $3,000 for the first time.

>The almost 2% advance in the S&P 500 was set to be the biggest since the aftermath of the presidential election. Not even data showing a slide in consumer confidence prevented the market rebound. That follows a selloff that culminated in a 10% plunge of the US equity benchmark from its peak. Treasuries trimmed a recent rally fueled by a flight to safety. Bullion climbed as much as 0.5% to $3,004.94 an ounce before erasing gains.

>The moves capped a week of drama that included Trump’s on-and-off-again tariffs, recession calls, geopolitical talks and concerns over a US government shutdown. Combined with all the questioning around lofty tech valuations, global equity funds saw their biggest redemption this year.

>“The markets are grappling with the notion of where fair value rests for a stock market that faces headwinds from tariffs, fiscal spending cuts, and potentially softening economic data, said Yung-Yu Ma at BMO Wealth Management. “Negative investor sentiment is building, so a multi-day relief rally could be coming soon.”

>Despite Friday’s advance, the S&P 500 still headed toward a fourth straight week of losses — the longest such streak since August. Trading volume was 10% below the average of the past month. Tech megacaps led gains on Friday, with Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. up at least 3.3%. The Nasdaq 100 climbed 2.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4%.

>The yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced three basis points to 4.30%. A dollar gauge fell 0.2%.

>“We are seeing some oversold rally efforts once again,” said Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott. “But we caution folks looking to dive back in at the first sign of stability here: nearly everyone is looking for a bottom and to ‘buy the dip’ at some point, but the current condition of the markets has not implied any real improvement on a technical basis - the tape is simply very oversold at this stage.”

>“We don’t know. We would like to see a capitulation trade, but the seasonals are starting to turn,” Brenner said. “The end of February to the middle of March is an awful time for equity seasonals.”

>It took just 16 trading sessions for US stocks to tumble into a correction, leaving a frazzled Wall Street asking just how long the “adjustment period” White House officials have warned about will last.

>In the prior 24 instances when stocks have fallen at least 10% from a record but avoided a bear market, it has taken an average of eight months to reclaim an all-time high, according to data from CFRA Research. That would leave the Feb. 19 high intact until mid-October. The average drawdown reached 14% in those cases.

>“Corrections are unnerving in the moment, though they are not unusual, and often act as a pressure release valve for overheated markets,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide. “This will not be the last correction, pullback, or market scare that the bulls will have to face, and yes, an element of caution is warranted.”

>“We say this is a correction, not a bear market in US stocks,” Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Hartnett said. “Since equity bear threatens recession, fresh declines in stock prices will provoke flip in trade and monetary policy.”

1jbbfux,Tesla warns of retaliatory tariffs. BofA thinks Trump will flip on trade policy,"Two articles today that gave me a lot more confidence about the market.

""Tesla warns Trump administration it is ‘exposed’ to retaliatory tariffs"" from [Financial times](https://www.ft.com/content/605295c5-dc8f-4247-ba35-8036b5058915) ([archive link](https://archive.ph/Oic88)). A snippet from the letter:

>“Nonetheless, even with aggressive localisation of the supply chain, certain parts and components are difficult or impossible to source within the US,” the company added. It urged Greer to “further evaluate domestic supply chain limitations to ensure that US manufacturers are not unduly burdened by trade actions that could result in the imposition of cost-prohibitive tariffs on necessary components”.

>Though administration officials have repeatedly said that they view the current stock market correction as a temporary reaction to the president’s pro-Main Street agenda, eventually Trump will react, the bank’s chief investment strategist said in his weekly analysis of market trends.

>“We say this is a correction, not a bear market in U.S. stocks,” Hartnett wrote. ”[M]arkets stop panicking when policy makers start panicking’ … since equity bear threatens recession, fresh declines in stock prices will provoke flip in trade & monetary policy back to ‘he loves me’ stance.”

But will the selling continue? Is today the bottom?

>Hartnett thinks the market damage will be limited, but he doesn’t expect the selling is over yet.

>The large-cap S&P 500 index would be “a good buy” should it hit 5,300, which would be another 4% lower from Thursday’s close, and when institutional investors’ cash levels surge above 4%.

>One “ominous” sign that he sees during the current sell-off is the simultaneous decline in both stocks and Treasury yields, a trend he said is similar to market behavior in 2000, 2002 and the 2008 financial crisis period.

>“Good news is financial conditions [are] easing” Hartnett noted, citing lower yields as well as declines in the U.S. dollar and oil.” Hartnett added that “corrections end once sell-off ‘laggards’ crack,” citing rising credit spreads.

>“Bottom line…up-in-stocks, up-in-yields, up-in-dollar positioning painfully up-in-smoke thus far in ’25, but sentiment/positioning/price signal equity correction not quite over,” he said.

1jbb6g3,"Apple’s Siri Chief Calls Siri AI Delays Ugly and Embarrassing, Promises Fixes","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/apple-s-siri-chief-calls-ai-delays-ugly-and-embarrassing-promises-fixes

Apple Inc.’s top executive overseeing its Siri virtual assistant told staff that delays to key features have been ugly and embarrassing, and a decision to publicly promote the technology before it was ready made matters worse.

Robby Walker, who serves as a senior director at Apple, delivered the stark comments during an all-hands meeting for the Siri division, saying that the team was facing a bad period. Walker also said that it’s unclear when the enhancements will actually launch, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the gathering was private.

The frank discussion shows the extent of Apple’s crisis in the field of artificial intelligence, where it’s struggling to catch up with peers. Siri — less advanced than rival systems — has become a symbol of Apple’s AI challenges. And the company’s woes boiled over last week, when it acknowledged publicly that critical features would be delayed indefinitely. 

During the all-hands gathering, Walker suggested that employees on his team may be feeling angry, disappointed, burned out and embarrassed after the features were postponed. The company had been racing to get the technology ready for this spring, but now the features aren’t expected until next year at the earliest, people familiar with the matter have said. 

Still, he praised the team for developing “incredibly impressive” features and vowed to deliver an industry-leading virtual assistant to consumers. 

On Feb. 14, Bloomberg News reported that Apple was struggling with bugs and engineering problems on its planned artificial intelligence tools for Siri. At the time, the company postponed the release from April to May, aiming to include the features in its iOS 18.5 operating system. Now it’s looking to add them as an update as early as the iOS 19 software cycle next year.

The features — unveiled last June at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference — are fundamental to making Siri a more effective personal assistant. The technology will allow the software to tap into users’ personal data to better respond to queries. It also will let Siri more precisely control apps and analyze content that’s on a user’s screen.

But when Apple demonstrated the features at WWDC using a video mock-up, it only had a barely working prototype, Bloomberg has reported. Walker told staff in the meeting that the delays were especially “ugly” because Apple had already showed off the features publicly. “This was not one of these situations where we get to show people our plan after it’s done,” he said. “We showed people before.”

“To make matters worse,” Walker said, Apple’s marketing communications department wanted to promote the enhancements. Despite not being ready, the capabilities were included in a series of marketing campaigns and TV commercials starting last year.

Apple touted the features as a key selling point of the iPhone 16 line, which otherwise lacked major changes. And it’s part of a broader AI push called Apple Intelligence.

Walker also raised doubts about even meeting the current release expectations. Though Apple is aiming for iOS 19, it “doesn’t mean that we’re shipping then,” Walker said. The company has several more priorities in development, and trade-offs will need to be made, he said.

“We have other commitments across Apple to other projects,” Walker said, citing new software and hardware initiatives. “We want to keep our commitments to those, and we understand those are now potentially more timeline-urgent than the features that have been deferred.” He said decisions on timing will be made on a “case-by-case basis” as work progresses on products planned for next year.

“Customers are not expecting only these new features but they also want a more fully rounded-out Siri,” he said. “We’re going to ship these features and more as soon as they are ready.”

Walker said that there is “intense personal accountability” about this effort shared by his boss John Giannandrea, the head of AI at Apple, as well as software chief Craig Federighi and other executives.

As of Friday, Apple doesn’t plan to immediately fire any top executives over the AI crisis, according to people with knowledge of the matter. That decision could theoretically change at any time. In any case, the company is poised to make management adjustments. It has discussed moving more senior executives under Giannandrea to assist with a turnaround effort. Already, the company tapped longtime executive Kim Vorrath — seen as a project fixer — to assist the group.

Walker said the decision to delay the features was made because of quality issues and that the company has found the technology only works properly up to two-thirds to 80% of the time. He said the group “can make more progress to get those percentages up, so that users get something they can really count on.”

In recent weeks, Federighi voiced concerns to other senior executives that the features weren’t working as advertised, ultimately prompting the decision to delay, Bloomberg reported. Issues with Apple Intelligence were clear from the start, with the company postponing the first batch of features last year and providing vague timelines during its launch event.

Walker defended his Siri group, telling them that they should be proud. Employees poured their “hearts and souls into this thing,” he said. “I saw so many people giving everything they had in order to make this happen and to make incredible progress together.”

But Apple wants to maintain a high bar and only deliver the features when they’re polished, he said. “These are not quite ready to go to the general public, even though our competitors might have launched them in this state or worse.”

He showed examples during the meeting of the technology working: It was able to locate his driver’s license number on command and find specific photos of a child. He also demonstrated how the technology could precisely manipulate apps via voice control. It embedded content in an email, added recipients and made other changes.

Walker told staff that they should “feel really proud of innovative work” done to develop the personal search feature, despite saying it doesn’t always work sufficiently.

Still, the company has met other goals for Siri. That includes bringing a Type-to-Siri interface to iOS 18, as well as adding Apple product knowledge to the platform and an improved understanding of customers. It’s planning to offer Apple Intelligence in several new languages next month and is working overtime to enable the features for China as part of partnerships with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc.

The executive said he didn’t want things to get worse before they got better, saying that special attention will need to be paid to the integration of existing features into iOS 19.

But there’s still a long road ahead. The delayed Siri features are just the first step toward modernizing the software. Apple has been planning upgrades for 2027 that will make Siri more conversational, letting it better compete with other AI chatbots, Bloomberg has reported.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jbb6g3/apples_siri_chief_calls_siri_ai_delays_ugly_and/,1741978275.0

1jb8fno,"EU’s big Starlink headache is time, not money","LONDON, March 14 (Reuters Breakingviews) - As relations between Ukraine and the Trump administration sour, Kyiv has encountered a pressing problem: it relies on Starlink to help its military coordinate operations. The good news is that it wouldn’t break the bank to replace Elon Musk’s satellite operator with kit supplied by $3 billion Anglo-French rival Eutelsat (ETL.PA), opens new tab. The bad news is that executing such a switch would be highly complex – and couldn’t happen overnight.

As things stand it doesn’t look like Musk will imminently axe Ukraine’s Starlink access, which is part funded by Poland. He just wants the world to know there would be devastating consequences if he did. In a March 9 post on X, formerly known as Twitter, the billionaire claimed Ukraine’s “entire front line would collapse” without links to his satellites. Though he went on to insist he’d never pull the plug, such episodes underline the case for using a satellite operator based in the European Union.

At first glance, the costs of such a swap might appear to be a major barrier. Providing internet from space requires terminals on the ground to transmit satellite signals to end users, and analysts estimate the price of one Eutelsat ground terminal is around $10,000. Musk’s company, by comparison, offers terminals to Ukrainian consumers at less than $600 each. Assuming each of Starlink’s 40,000 or so terminals in Ukraine is eventually swapped out with a Eutelsat one, the replacement drive would cost $400 million before the internet is even switched on.

Weighed against the EU’s $17 trillion GDP this expense looks bearable, though. The European Commission is talking about mobilising 800 billion euros for defence, including 150 billion euros in loans for member states to spend on weapons. Throw in scope to raise pandemic-style joint debt at the EU level, and the bloc should be both able and willing to fund a satcom switch for Ukraine.

What’s less clear is whether Eutelsat’s OneWeb constellation has the satellite heft to deliver a quality of internet comparable to Musk’s outfit. Eutelsat has around 650 satellites in low earth orbit, far less than Starlink’s 7,000-strong fleet. Calculations by investment bank Bryan Garnier suggest the OneWeb constellation could only offer Ukraine one or two dozen gigabits of data per second (GBPS), a rate sufficient to supply around 10,000 residential ground terminals. Eutelsat has a powerful satellite in farther-flung geostationary orbit that could help to fill the gap, but whether the result is connectivity on par with Starlink’s is uncertain.

Capacity concerns aside, there are also questions around Eutelsat’s ability to roll out the new terminals on the ground at the necessary pace. The company’s CEO Eva Berneke told Bloomberg, opens new tab that the group would be capable of sourcing 40,000 of them in a matter of months. But unlike Starlink, which makes all its own equipment, Eutelsat relies on third parties to supply its terminals. These vary in terms of size and capabilities, with several bulky and power-hungry designs in the mix.

Even if Eutelsat can get its hands on the kit in a matter of months, there’s no guarantee that the mix of those terminals would meet the actual demands of Ukraine’s forces on the ground, according to Hamish Low of Enders Analysis. Matching terminals to the appropriate locations and users will take time.

One consolation is that Ukraine doesn’t necessarily need all of its Starlink capacity to fight a war with Russia. Some of the terminals in the country are used by civilians for day-to-day communications, while others support government institutions.

Another consolation is that Eutelsat may have some breathing space. The U.S. agreed on March 12 to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Compared with last month, when Trump administration negotiators reportedly raised the possibility of cutting off Starlink if a critical minerals deal failed to materialise, that arguably counts as a conciliatory turn.
At 6 euros, Eutelsat shares have risen fivefold in the two weeks since Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s infamous White House encounter with Trump. That’s still far below the 30 euros-plus at which they traded a decade ago, and the company still has around 2.5 billion euros of net debt. Either way investors seem confident that Eutelsat will be a winner in Europe’s rearmament – the question is how committed EU politicians are to ramping it up.

This has led to a backlash against the company, with some owners expressing buyer's remorse and others vandalizing Tesla vehicles and property. Despite this, Tesla's popularity has increased among Republicans and conservatives, with some surveys showing a significant rise in favorable opinions of the company among this group. However, analysts note that this shift may not necessarily translate to increased sales, as the demographic most interested in electric vehicles - liberals and progressives - is being driven away from the brand.

Overall a hell of a bounce (and earnings for the stock), not too interested in going long after the earnings announcement but if we spike up I'm interested in fading the move. Cloud data/data security earnings, this company typically moves on revenue outlook (especially because it's still in its early stages).

[**PTON (Peloton Interactive)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PTON&p=d)

Canaccord Genuity upgraded Peloton to a 'Buy' rating with a price target of $10, stating, ""Peloton is the clear leader in the connected fitness industry, which it invested in early on and built a 6M loyal member base that has a high-margin recurring revenue stream... Peloton is at the turning point in its journey where there is meaningful upside potential from current levels."" I think this catalyst is dumb and I usually don't think about price target calls (like with Reddit earlier this week) but this HAS moved the stock. Overall interested to see if we make an additional upmove after the open. The connected fitness industry is undergoing a transformation, with companies focusing on subscription-based models to drive recurring revenue. Overall the catalyst might end up falling flat completely, as some PT calls do.

[**DOCU (DocuSign)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DOCU&p=d)

Reported Q4 earnings of $0.86 vs $0.84. exp, revenue of $776.3M. Interested in seeing if we continue in the upmove today, otherwise not that interested. We're NEVER going to see COVID highs again (seriously, look at the 5 year chart of DOCU) and I don't like this as a long-term investment.

1jb2v4n,Opportunities outside the U.S. stock market,"As the US government under Donald Trump threatens the world with tariffs, I don’t see market volatility going down anytime soon. We will likely continue to see huge downturns in the US stock market continue for the next 6 months, as these tariffs aren’t even fixed. Trump adds them and removes them as he pleases, creating a lot of uncertainty for many businesses.

As such, I have started looking outside the US stock market for better opportunities. There will never be opportunities as good as the US stock market, as it has the largest trading volume and is also the most valuable stock market. But as the world becomes more industrialised, it’s a global market and there’s increasingly more opportunities everywhere.

I’m currently ruling out Europe and the rest of North America for now. The tariffs are directed to these nations and it doesn’t look like it’s going stop anytime soon. China used to be a good alternative but I think we’re gonna see a lot of tariffs towards it by Trump soon, I wouldn’t invest in it. Plus, it’s pretty restrictive on who can invest and how much.

Most western nations are somehow the prime target of Trump, so Australia and New Zealand will likely be affected soon too. Plus, their economies are pretty small, with only a few niche exports (mostly natural resources). I just know Japan and South Korea are next, Trump won’t spare them and has talked many times about tariffing them hard.

I’ve been looking at South East Asia, the Middle East, South America and Africa. I know these are emerging economies but I’m grasping at thin air here. The US economy looks like it’s gonna be going down a while and it’s gonna bring every other major economy with it. It truly looks like the unravelling of free trade agreements happening in real time.

Anyone who’s looked into stocks from these regions, what are some good ones to invest in, and what industries in particular should I look for?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jb2v4n/opportunities_outside_the_us_stock_market/,1741955722.0
1jb0pgw,Next options expiration deadline? Will the expiration trigger the big rebound?,"The options expiration is the deadline by which the holder of an option can exercise their right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a previously agreed price, known as the strike price. If the holder does not exercise their right before this date, the option expires and loses its value.

Everything points to the fact that next Friday, March 21, will be a key date.

March 21, 2025, is a significant date in financial markets, as it is the third Friday of March. Traditionally, options and futures contracts usually have their expiration dates on the third Friday of each month. Therefore, on this date, numerous options and futures contracts on various assets will expire, which could lead to an increase in volatility and trading volume in the financial markets.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

The feature will be offered as a part of an AirPods software upgrade later this year, the report said, and will be tied to the iOS 19 update to its mobile operating system.

Rival earbuds such as Google's Pixel Buds have had the option for years, the report said.
Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The company had last year said its AirPods Pro 2 can be turned into a personalized hearing aid via software updates.

Apple is planning a major overhaul to its software later on this year and will change the look of its operating systems and interface of its iPhone, iPad and Mac, Bloomberg reported on Monday.

1jatjdk,upcoming Fed meeting .. how are you playing it ?,"The Fed meeting and press conference is on next wednesday.  
The CME fedwatch survey shows market expects Fed to do 2-3 rate cuts this year.

But in my view, with the present uncertainty with fast changing tariff rules and DOGE based cuts, the Fed cannot model it's affect on the inflation and unemployment.  
Without a working model and predictions, ***Fed cannot realistically cut rates***.

The best they can do is hold rates and wait for some clarity on how much tariffs will be applied into this year and next. And then decide on whether to cut or raise rates. The affect of tariff will take time to show up in the economy and there is still time for Fed to act.

And if Fed acts early and say makes a rate cut , and 2 months later we end-up with high inflation, it will make things a lot worse and raising rates will panic the market.

Additionally the deportation hasn't picked up and it will also affect the economy in unknown ways. Deportation can cut unemployment and raise inflation, which would force Fed to maintain rates or in worse case raise them.

The Fed rate cut expectations from traders/investors, is more out of desperation hoping that cut will boost the market. It will be very dangerous to act early and Fed having seen the inflation past 2 years will be cautious.

I expect Powell to not commit to any rate cut, instead sweet talk saying we are watching closely and in case of any risk of recession, high unemployment or liquidity crisis, we will act aggressively. But right now we are waiting to see how the tariff affects unfolds and we will follow the data.  
In short talk encouraging but not commit to any rate cut.

Am interested in your views ( to make sure I am not thinking wrong or crazy.)

I am 18 and I have around 10k+ lying around; I make around 200 dollars every weekday cause of a little side hustle but that won't last long. I keep seeing posts and videos that for people with money available for investing, a recession is a golden opportunity to get rich. I need to take care of my mother, and the 10,000 I have is not enough for that.

Can someone guide me to where I can learn about what is going on and what I can do to take advantage of this recession?

**Top Lessons:**
- Value investing centers on acquiring ownership in businesses by assessing their true worth, rather than trading stocks based on market momentum.
- The research-driven process requires investors to methodically analyze financial data and business operations, setting aside emotional biases or snap judgments to determine a company's long-term potential.
- Value investors emphasize a company's core fundamentals— such as consistent cash flows, tangible assets, and reliable earnings-over transient market price swings. By anchoring their focus on these measurable attributes, they avoid being swayed by speculative trends or short-lived volatility in stock valuations.
- The practice of value investing involves calculating a company's intrinsic economic value, derived from its financial statements and operational performance, which remains steadier than its market price. This disciplined valuation approach allows investors to pinpoint opportunities where the stock price diverges significantly from the business's underlying worth.
- Patience and discipline are essential in value investing, as stocks bought at a discount to their intrinsic value often need months or years to reach their fair market price. Investors must commit to holding these positions, trusting that over time, the market will adjust to reflect the company's fundamental strengths.
- Value investors target stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios, typically indicating that a company's market price undervalues its earnings capacity relative to peers. Rather than chasing popular or overhyped stocks, they seek out these underappreciated opportunities, which statistical evidence suggests offer a greater margin of safety and return potential.
- Evaluating a company's competitive advantages—such as cost efficiencies from scale, strong customer loyalty, or patented technologies—is a key step in identifying businesses with durable profitability. These advantages, quantifiable through market share data or profit margins, signal a company's ability to maintain its economic edge and deliver sustained value to shareholders.

The US stock market can flip into a correction territory as retail and institutional buyers are running out of steam, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Scott Rubner, the bank’s managing director for global markets and tactical specialist.

“The flow dynamics change dramatically starting Monday and I am on correction watch,” Rubner wrote in a note to clients Thursday.

US stocks hit a new record high on Wednesday despite uncertainty around tariffs and the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate path. Strong gains have been driven by resilient corporate earnings and strong flows from retail and institutional investors. But these dynamics could change starting from Monday, Rubner wrote.

Demand from retail traders, which have been piling into US stocks at a record pace this year, is expected to slow down ahead of the tax paying season in March. Flows from pension funds can also “run out of juice,” according to Rubner attributing it to seasonal trends. January and February are typically the strongest months of the year for yearly asset allocations, followed by weaker inflows in March.

Positioning across trend-following systematic funds also looks bearish. Commodity trading advisers, or CTAs, which buy or sell stocks depending on the market direction, are estimated to sell about $61 billion in US stocks over the next month should markets go lower, compared to only about $10 billion of buying in a bullish scenario.

On top of that, options market positioning also points to some volatility. According to Goldman’s estimates, dealers are currently long $9.8 billion of S&P 500 gamma, which acts as a market buffer when dealers are buying the dip. However, the bank’s index trading team estimates that 50% of this long gamma position rolls off Friday, and the market will have the ability to move more freely next week.

1jalltg,Stocks Tumble Into Correction as Investors Sour on Trump,"he world’s most widely followed stock-market benchmark slid into a correction on Thursday, a drop that underscores how the two-year-long bull market is running out of steam in the early days of the Trump administration.

The move stems from investors’ growing pessimism about the whipsawing policy pronouncements from Washington over the past few weeks. On-again, off-again tariffs and mass layoffs of federal workers have fomented unease on Wall Street.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent. After weeks of selling, the index is now down 10.1 percent from a peak that was reached less than one month ago and is in a correction — a Wall Street term for when an index falls 10 percent or more from its peak, and a line in the sand for investors worried about a sell-off gathering steam.

Other major indexes, including the Russell 2000 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, had already fallen into correction before Thursday.

The deeper worry among investors is that uncertainty around the effects of Mr. Trump’s policies is causing consumers to spend less and discouraging businesses from investing. That reticence could, in turn, drive the economy into a downturn, forcing investors to re-evaluate company valuations.

“I think what markets are telling us is that they are very concerned about the potential for a recession,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “That is certainly not what markets expected going into 2025.”

So far, the administration has brushed off the market turmoil. Scott Bessent, secretary of the U.S. Treasury, said on Thursday that he was focused on the “real economy”, downplaying signals sent by business leaders and investors. “I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks,” he said.

As stocks have been falling in recent weeks, the Trump Administration has emphasized that its economic policies are designed to promote job growth over the long term, but could cause some market turmoil in the near term.

Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the economy has already begun to be “negatively impacted.”

The pain has been acutely felt among the behemoth tech companies that had driven the market higher in recent years but have since reversed course. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has fallen roughly 14 percent from its peak in December.

The sell-off has also spread to other corners of the market, signaling broader concerns than simply a re-pricing of highly valued technology companies. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which are typically more exposed to the ups and downs of the economy, has fallen 18 percent from its peak in November, close to a fully fledged bear market, defined as a drop of 20 percent or more from its peak.

Sectors of the stock market exposed to tariffs, like food producers, have slumped. The effects are being felt on other companies, like airlines, that are worried about a pullback among consumers should the economy enter a downturn.

“So far in 2025, the U.S. economy has only faced headwinds,” Ms. Shah said.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump threatened to impose 200 percent tariffs on European wine and champagne, one day after the European Union announced retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. whiskey and several other American products. The president has already added tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and a wide swath of products from China.

The constantly moving goal posts have left investors so rattled that even recent good news about the economy hasn’t had a calming effect. On Thursday, a report on weekly unemployment claims came in lower than expected. On Wednesday, a better-than-expected reading of the Consumer Price Index had briefly helped bolster stocks.

Investors are worried that tariffs, once in full effect, will push prices higher — hurting business and consumers. Mr. Trump’s immigration policies and firings of federal employees through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are also looming in the backdrop, as is the threat of an impending government shutdown.

“The outlook for inflation depends more on tariffs, deportations and DOGE than the backward-looking data releases right now,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said on Thursday.

""A faster timeline appears likely given geopolitical events in recent weeks, in our view. Reaching 3% of GDP by 2030 would offer a 12% CAGR in defence spending.""

QinetiQ and Renk were also kept at buy, with price targets bumped up to 6.10 pounds and 44.40 euros, respectively, from 5.00 pounds and 33.30 euros.

Bear Case: 

With the current economic instability and uncertainty, many stocks from all industries have seen sharp decreases in value. For the case of this write up, I will mostly be focused on hotel, restaurant, and airline industries, since these industries are closely correlated and are considered elastic goods. Moreover, tourism to the United States, which is a key revenue source for these industries, will likely be down going forward due to rises in foreign tensions. Many Canadians are already talking about cancelling and boycotting travel to the United States, so these industries will feel the repercussions in the following months/years.

Airlines: 
Delta: -30% in the past month
United Airlines: -28% in the past month
American Airlines: -30% in the past month

Restaurants/Food:
Sbux: -12.7% in the past month
Cava: -37% in the past month
Wingstop: -30% in the past month
Chipotle: -14% in the past month

Hotels:
Hyatt: -15.33% in the past month
Mariott: -15.4% in the past month
Hilton: -15.26% in the past month

$DRI has not yet taken a hit from the recent economic turmoil, only dropping 5% in the past month. Due to the target audience of its restaurants, I believe that they are more susceptible to the affects of a recession than fast food restaurants such as Wingstop, Chipotle, and Cava, which have seen significant dips recently. 

Restaurants like Olive Garden and Longhorse steakhouse are treated as a night out for lower class/lower middle class Americans, and will be among the first expenses to be cut when budgets inevitably tighten. I believe in the case of a recession, more Americans will ditch restaurants like Olive Garden and Longhorse steakhouse than Chipotle, Wingstop, and Cava.

For reference here is how $DRI performed during the past recessions/pullbacks

2008: -68.5% decrease
2020: -63% decrease
2022: -25% decrease

I believe $DRI has much room to fall over the next year and maybe even longer.

While InPost maintains advantages in density, retailer agnosticism, and a loyal customer base through its own app, Allegro's move could pose challenges for InPost in its core market Poland (c.60% of revenue).

Tesla’s stock price continues to show volatility in early March trading, falling 0.9% in premarket activity after two days of gains. This follows Monday’s steep 15.4% drop that marked the company’s worst trading day in nearly five years.

The electric vehicle maker saw its shares rebound 7.6% on Wednesday and 3.8% on Tuesday. These gains came after President Donald Trump’s public commitment to purchase a Tesla Model S during a White House event with CEO Elon Musk.

1jabuk5,wash sale question!,"Good morning.

I have a wash sale tax question. Please help if you can.

I bought some SPY shares on 09/2024 and again on 12/2024, 1/2025, 2/2025, and 3/2025. All the shares bought since 12/2024 are bought within 30 days of each other.

Obviously, all the shares that I bought since 12/2024 are now in the red. I have some capital gains by selling other shares and would like to tax harvest these SPY shares.

If I sell all the SPY shares that I bought since 12/2024 and realize a loss of around 20k, (I can buy VTI right away). Would this trigger a wash sale?

It seems like I am clear for the 30days look back (since I didn't buy any SPY between 09/2024 and 12/2024) and I am not buying SPY or anything similar 30 days from now, I should be in the clear. However because I made many purchases between 12/2024 and 03/2025 (but I sell all those shares), I am not sure how the tax law treats these purchases. For example, the loss from the 03/2025 lot would trigger the wash sale on the 02/2025 lot etc.

1ja8nzv,"This company can beat SpaceX, ending Elon’s monopoly","The bullish case for Rocket Lab (RKLB)

In Private Space Exploration, we often only hear about Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin is just a way for him to burn money and Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic is a complete and total failure (I think it was just a publicity stunt).

But, there exists one other end-to-end space company, and it is the only one currently making revenue and has actual customers (apart from SpaceX). Its Electon rocket is the most used small rocket in the world and is the second-most used orbital rocket in the world (SpaceX’s falcon 9 is the most used rocket in the world).

Rocket Lab is current working on Neutron, which is set to be a much bigger rocket and will cost less than SpaceX’s Falcon 9. It will also have a higher payload capacity than Falcon 9.

I got interested in this company after hearing these fundamentals. It’s not easy to make a rocket company, and it’s even more difficult to actually get clients for it and make the company successful. Electron to date has delivered more than 200 satellites to orbit.

Then I decided to find out more about the founder of this company. Unlike Elon Musk, who isn’t a rocket engineer and had $200 million from the sale of PayPal to burn with SpaceX, the CEO of Peter Beck is from New Zealand and a college dropout. He worked as in various engineering companies at low positions and learnt how to make rocket fuel on his own. With his hands-on experience and accomplishments, he tried to come to America and work for NASA, but was laughed out off the office because he didn’t have a college degree, and was a foreigner.

He went back to New Zealand and with very little capital from 1 investor, Mark Rocket, he started Rocket Lab. During its early days, he described himself vommiting in the toilet before every launch as 1 failure could break the entire company. To date, the company has launched the Electron Rocket to orbit 60 times successfully.

When asked how he’s built rocket lab into such a consistently successful launch services provider, his response was that they “just kept their head down and worked hard” and will continue to do so, regardless of whether they got the fame most space companies get in the media. This is a much better attitude than Elon’s.

I think Rocket Lab has potential to become a $100 billion company!

1ja6mud,Could Europe's Eutelsat help to replace Starlink in Ukraine?,"HOW DOES EUTELSAT COMPARE TO STARLINK?

Eutelsat already supports government and institutional communications in Ukraine, and told Reuters that it can provide an alternative for certain government and defence applications.

Since its merger in 2023 with Britain's OneWeb, Eutelsat controls the only operational global-coverage constellation, besides Starlink, of satellites in low earth orbit (LEO).

Starlink's more than 7,000 LEO satellites, suited to real-time communication, allow it to reach more users around the world and offer higher data speeds.

But Eutelsat says that, even with only 630 or so LEO satellites, backed up by 35 linked satellites in higher, geostationary orbit, it offers the same capabilities as Starlink in Europe.

Starlink promises broadband at up to 200 megabits per second, Eutelsat 150.

OneWeb terminals, however, cost as much as $10,000, plus a monthly subscription price. Starlink charges Ukrainian users a one-time payment of $589 in addition to a monthly subscription of $95-$440, depending on the usage.

It is not known whether any donor would offer to fund more Ukrainian OneWeb subscriptions. France and Britain, which are spearheading a peace deal to present to the U.S., hold a combined 24.8% stake in Eutelsat Group.

1ja1j0d,No $LUV here,"Wanted to get some thoughts on Southwest’s new “no free bags” policy. On paper, I get that it could boost revenue, but I don’t see how $LUV can compete now that they’re essentially just another airline. Their stock is already trading at a 40 P/E ratio—the highest in the airline industry—and I’m struggling to justify that valuation.

For context, I fly about 35 times a year for work and took 20+ Southwest flights last year. In many cases, their fares are as expensive—if not more expensive—than Delta or American, yet both of those airlines offer a significantly better experience. Southwest also has inconvenient flight times for business travelers, with many departures in the mid-morning, early afternoon, or late at night (8 PM or later).

Beyond that, they don’t offer lounge access—small detail, but another premium feature their competitors have that they don’t. And of course, we all remember the massive tech failures that caused travel disruptions last year. I just don’t see how they make the jump to a premium airline identity like United, American, or Delta - which is who they will be competing with. More likely, they evolve into something of a hybrid between Spirit and their former self—a budget airline with easy to understand rules (no assigned seats), a fun brand (wanna get away), a few perks and clear and transparent fares but nothing truly differentiating anymore.

Given all this, I’m seriously considering shorting $LUV, and targeting a future $12-18 per share price within the next 12 months. Curious to hear what others think.

1j9zdif,"Trump: New travel barriers for Canadian tourists, the biggest source of US tourism. Expect impact on airlines, hotels, retail, restaurants","Today the Trump administration announced new visitation barriers for Canadian tourists. Any tourists staying longer than 30 days must register and provide fingerprints to authorities. How many Canadians actually vacation longer for 30 days+ in the US you may ask?

* **1 million snowbirds (Canadian tourists** travelling to the US to avoid Canadian winters) reportedly **contributed $6.5b** to Florida's economy **during just a 6 month period** (typical duration of their stays)
* **Canadians were the largest visitors to the US** comprising of **\~30% of all US tourist visits** in 2023.
* Those tourists with billions in combined disposable income just had it harder to come to the US to spend their money
* While this policy in isolation may not have a material impact, combined with instigating a trade war and threats of annexation seemed to have turned off many Canadians (rightfully so) on spending a single penny in the US.
* Since Canada was the only country previously exempted from this rule, reversing this is policy is leaving many Canadians feeling further alienated by the US, especially given their economic contributions to local US economies

I'm bearish for Q2, Q3, and potentially Q4 for the following industries

* **REITs**: NNN REIT, Drop in tourism will bankrupt many small US businesses with thin margins in the restaurant industry. While you can't make investment moves on small businesses, this will lead to defaulting on their leases and commercial REITs that focus on restaurants will have high vacancy rates.
* **Travel Bookers**: Expedia? Not sure how much of their revenue concentration is based on US bookings vs. global
* **Hotels:** Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Air Bnb, Caesars Entertainment
* **Airlines:** American, Delta, United, Air Canada,
* **QSRs:** Darden Restaurants, Texas Roadhouse, Brinker International (food chains primarily with US locations attract tourists due to the novelty factor of not being able to go in Canada)
* **Amusement Parks**: Disney, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, United Parks & Resorts
* **Car Rentals:** Enterprise, Hertz, Avis
* **Retail**: TJX Companies, Ross, Macys, Kohls, Target (retail stores with no presence in Canada are often attract tourists who are interested in shopping at retail stores they can't back in Canada)
* **Energy**: Shell, Chevron, Exxon (lots of Canadian tourists do road trips and gas up in the US, but since these companies also operate in Canada and Canadians are just going to replace their US road triups with Canadian ones, I do not believe they will be impacted

Other factors to consider before making moves

* Can US consumer spending or tourists from other countries fill the economic void Canadian tourists will leave in the tune of billions of dollars?
* Will other countries follow suite, either as a response to the US administrations polices, or in a sign of solidary with Canadians?
* Even if positive relations are restored between US-Canada by the end of the year, will that change souring Canadian consumer sentiment to US businesses and travel?

Edit: In no way is this post a dig at Canadians for deciding to stop visiting. I am also Canadian. This post is a purely from a finance/stock perspective on which industries will get negatively impacted by this administrations policies the most so that people here can adjust their portfolio allocations accordingly if they have exposure into said industries. Vive la Canada!

1j9ywql,Trump’s FTC Moves Ahead With Broad Microsoft Antitrust Probe,">The US Federal Trade Commission is moving ahead with a sprawling antitrust probe of Microsoft Corp. that was opened in the waning days of the Biden Administration, signaling that Donald Trump’s new FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson is going to prioritize scrutiny of tech giants.

>FTC staff in recent weeks have continued to work on the investigation, meeting with companies and other groups to gather information, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential investigation.

>The FTC sent Microsoft a so-called civil investigative demand, which is similar to a subpoena, late last year. The document, a copy of which was viewed by Bloomberg, compels the company to turn over reams of data about its AI operations, including the cost to train models and obtain data, going as far back as 2016. The agency sought details about Microsoft’s data centers, its struggles to find enough computing power to meet customer demand and the company’s software licensing practices.

>The FTC is also scrutinizing Microsoft’s decision to slash funding on its own artificial intelligence projects after striking a deal with OpenAI, which could be perceived as hurting competition in the burgeoning AI market.

>One company has heard regularly from the FTC on the issue of Microsoft’s licensing practices since the investigative demand was sent, said one of the people. The FTC and lawyers for that company have discussed what information the agency could ask for in a more comprehensive, formal request. The company also received a shorter list of questions several weeks ago asking for documents the company provided to other regulators. The FTC is further seeking information about licensing rule changes Microsoft said will go into effect later this year, the person said.

>The agency said in the information demand that it wants to determine whether Microsoft’s profits from other parts of the business give it an edge over other AI companies. The agency also said it wants details about Microsoft’s data center capacity constraints to better understand the costs behind cloud-computing services. Those details will help the agency determine whether to bring a case.

>Since receiving the FTC demand, Microsoft may have sought to narrow the scope of the information it’s being asked to turn over — a typical move by companies being probed by the agency. Such wide-ranging antitrust investigations can take years and don’t always result in the agency bringing a case.

>“We are working cooperatively with the agency,” said Alex Haurek, a Microsoft spokesman. The FTC didn’t respond to a request for comment.

>The evolution of the probe now rests in the hands of Ferguson and his new head of competition, Daniel Guarnera, who joined the agency from the Justice Department, where he worked on antitrust cases targeting Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Apple Inc.

>In his first public remarks since taking the chair position in late February, Ferguson said investigating the tech sector is his highest priority. Early moves include seeking information on censorship by tech companies.

>Ferguson also backed a filing in January in support of billionaire Elon Musk, who sued to derail OpenAI’s plans to restructure as a more conventional for-profit business.

>The civil investigative demand was crafted by FTC staff and personally signed off on by former Chair Lina Khan after the agency spent more than a year conducting informal interviews with Microsoft competitors and business partners, Bloomberg previously reported.

>Ferguson’s FTC has inherited several other cases against big tech companies from Khan, including lawsuits against Meta Platforms Inc. and [Amazon](http://Amazon.com) Inc. On Wednesday, the agency asked a judge to delay a trial challenging Amazon’s Prime subscription practices, citing resource constraints at the agency. The FTC quickly walked back comments that resource constraints at the agency will hamper its ability to start a trial in September.

>Most of the questions in the information demand relate to how Microsoft licenses its software products, particularly as it relates to the company’s cloud-computing business. Competitors have complained that Microsoft’s licensing terms and bundling of both its popular office productivity and security software with its cloud offerings makes it harder for them to compete.

>About a third of the questions focus on Microsoft’s AI business, highlighting the importance of the burgeoning technology to the company’s future. Underlying the FTC’s requests are concerns that Microsoft canceled some of its own work after deciding to invest in deciding to invest in OpenAI and learning heavily on its GPT software, eliminating potential competition.

>Despite the hefty sum, Microsoft didn’t disclose its investment to competition regulators ahead of time, and the FTC also has been investigating whether the deal was structured as a partnership to avoid a merger investigation, Bloomberg has reported.

>When Microsoft first invested in OpenAI in 2019, the startup was a promising research lab looking for a way to fund the cloud-computing power required to create AI models. Microsoft started with a $1 billion infusion after co-founder Musk withdrew his backing. Microsoft had been working on various AI projects of its own for more than two decades and feared it was falling behind rival Google.

>The company’s efforts were scattered across several divisions and not producing the results Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella had hoped for. In 2023, one month after pumping an additional $10 billion into OpenAI, Microsoft began unveiling a series of products infused with OpenAI technology. Microsoft pulled back on its internal effort to develop the technology, which raised a red flag for the FTC is going to prioritize scrutiny of tech giants.

>FTC staff in recent weeks have continued to work on the investigation, meeting with companies and other groups to gather information, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential investigation.

1j9wxq3,Adobe stock Analyst behaviour,"Adobe stock fall in after market of -4%(at the moment I write). Even if eps are over expectations, the analyst are worried about two things:
- Ai implementation is not good as competitors, so Adobe could lose the advantage
- the outlook for FY25, lower than expected by analysts.

Said that, I checked the Gaap numbers. The revenue is still growing, Q1/25 has better revenue compared to Q4/24 and Q1/24. All segments seems is still keeping the same % of revenues of last quarters. So basically nothing bad. 
Net income same story, slightly higher compared q1/q4. I do not like that Adobe is doing buyback at high prices and wasting money. A part of it, I do not see much changes. Why this behaviour by Wall Street? 
What I do not get by the Wall Street arguments? Also the Revenue outlook of FY25 not seem so bad to me. Summing the Q1/25 with the remaining 24, so the TTM is 22B. Them outlook is 23B. Not soo bad.

1j9u3rn,"Spotify says it paid nearly 1,500 artists $1 million or more in royalties for 2024 streams","Spotify is minting music millionaires.

Nearly 1,500 artists generated more than $1 million in royalties from Spotify in 2024, the company said Wednesday in its annual Loud and Clear Report.

Spotify said more than 80% of the artists in that pool did not have a song reach the app’s Global Daily Top 50 chart. To reach that million-dollar threshold, an artist would need to have around four to five million monthly listeners, or 20 million to 25 million monthly streams.

“Spotify has helped level the playing field for artists at every stage of their careers,” the company said in the report. “Success in the streaming era doesn’t require a decade-spanning catalog nor a chart-topping hit.”

The news comes about a month after the company reported a fourth-quarter earnings beat that saw the Swedish music streamer record its first full year of profitability.

Spotify said the upper echelon of royalties, artists who generate more than $10 million, has soared 600% since 2017, reaching a total of 70 for 2024.

The company said it paid an all-time high of $10 billion in royalties to the music industry for 2024, a figure it claimed is “more than any single retailer has ever paid in a year, and over 10x the contribution of the largest record store at the height of the CD era.”

Spotify does not pay per stream. Instead, it calculates a rights holder’s “streamshare,” or the percentage of streams they get out of a particular market.

1j9t8bb,Google introduces new AI models for rapidly growing robotics industry,"Google seems to be targeting the robotics industry with this news, which is an interesting investment. The robotics industry is relatively new for now and has not generated positive cashflow for the most part. 

Google said its models are designed for robots of all form factors including humanoids and other types used in factories and warehouses. Using robotics-focused AI models developed by the likes of Google and OpenAI can help cash-strapped startups reduce development costs and increase the speed at which they can take their product to market.

Google said it tested the Gemini Robotics model on data from its bi-arm robotics platform, ALOHA 2, but can be specialized for complex use cases such as Apptronik's Apollo robot.

Google's launch comes a month after robotics startup Figure AI [exited](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/robotics-startup-figure-ai-talks-new-funding-395-billion-valuation-bloomberg-2025-02-14/) its collaboration agreement with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI after it made an internal breakthrough in AI for robots.

There is a strong argument that the slower month-on-month CPI increase is due to weak consumer demand. Look at the breakdown of the categories.

Airline fares and gasoline prices dropped by 4.0% and 1.0% respectively. This suggests weaker consumer demand for travel.

New vehicle prices declined by 0.1%. This indicates consumers are holding back on large discretionary purchases. This also aligns with the consumer confidence index from a couple of weeks back which highlighted a drop in sentiment on large purchases in the near future by consumers

Overall the CPI and core CPI numbers reinforce my opinion that the economy is not doing well. Consumers are pulling back and businesses do not feel confident raising prices any more.

Like if the whole S and P 500 market is up, by what mechanism does the index fund go up? If, for whatever reason, people started selling off VOO, couldn’t the index fund go down despite its holdings appreciating in value?

1j9mlkx,Tesla investor survey shows 85% believe Elon Musk’s politics are having ‘negative’ or ‘extremely negative’ impact on company,"More than eight out of every 10 respondents to a Morgan Stanley survey believe Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s controversial political activities are hurting his business.

In total, 85% of the 245 participants polled by the firm believe Musk’s foray into politics has either had a “negative” or “extremely negative” impact on business fundamentals. The majority of respondents also expect Tesla deliveries to fall this year, according to the survey.

While a small sampling, these results offer the latest sign of mounting frustration with the billionaire entrepreneur as he’s become a rising figure in international and American politics. It also comes at a pivotal point for Tesla’s stock, with shares plunging nearly 40% this year.

When asked about Musk’s efforts with U.S. government efficiency and other political activities, 45% of respondents said these actions had a “negative” effect on the company. Another 40% said they were having an “extremely negative” impact.

On the other hand, 3% said they were “positive” for the business. Meanwhile, 12% called them “insignificant.”

To be sure, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reported that his survey respondents are drawn from his email distribution list and should not be taken as a random representative sample. He also noted that the respondents are not necessarily owners of Tesla stock. The survey was taken over a 17-hour period, starting on Tuesday afternoon.

Jonas also asked about expectations for the company’s performance. In a separate question, 59% said they anticipated Tesla would deliver fewer cars to customers in 2025 compared with the prior year. What’s more, 21% of total respondents said they expected a decline of more than 10%. That comes as some analysts have raised alarm that recent reports of vandalism could spook potential customers.

Just 19% of responders said they forecasted deliveries to rise in 2025, while another 23% said they would be flat between the two years.

Musk’s political profile has grown after his public support of President Donald Trump in the runup up to last year’s election and his subsequent role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla executive’s efforts to slash the federal government’s spending and workforce has drawn the ire of critics who see his team as working too quickly and haphazardly.

Musk acknowledged in an interview with Fox Business on Monday that his high-profile role in Trump’s administration meant he was running his businesses, which also include X and SpaceX, “with great difficulty.” That day, Tesla shares tumbled more than 15% for their worst session since 2020.

Despite the recent nosedive, 45% of respondents said they anticipate Tesla shares will be at least 11% higher by the end of the calendar year. Around 36% expect the stock to tumble another 11% or further by year-end, while 19% see the stock staying within 10% of its price around $220.

After a New York Times report last week unearthed criticisms of Musk’s team from members of Trump’s cabinet, the president offered a vote of confidence on Tuesday. Trump evaluated five Tesla models parked at the White House after the president said on social media that he would buy one as a symbol of support.

Trump also said he would declare violence at Tesla dealerships to be acts of domestic terrorism.

TSM has proposed a joint venture to Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom to operate Intel's foundry division, with TSM managing the operations but holding less than a 50% stake. We saw INTC make a decent bounce in the overnight yesterday on that news, but it looks like we're giving back most of those gains. This move comes as Intel faces significant losses in its manufacturing division, the CHIPS Act is targeted by Trump, so frankly a very good positive catalyst but I don't expect much to come of this. The possibility of a joint venture between these 4 companies actually happening seems fantastical, especially with Trump stating that he wants to scrap the CHIPS Act and instead work on tariffs on semis.

The company's stock has experienced a nearly 50% decline from recent highs within the past month. I thought this was interesting yesterday near the open so I bought some stock, overall still holding but interested to see where it goes after the open.

Amazon, Alphabet’s Google and Meta Platforms on Wednesday said they support efforts to at least triple nuclear energy worldwide by 2050.

The tech companies signed a pledge first adopted in December 2023 by more than 20 countries, including the U.S., at the U.N. Climate Change Conference. Financial institutions including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley backed the pledge last year.


The pledge is nonbinding, but highlights the growing support for expanding nuclear power among leading industries, finance and governments.

Amazon, Google and Meta are increasingly important drivers of energy demand in the U.S. as they build out artificial intelligence centers. The tech sector is turning to nuclear power after concluding that renewables alone won’t provide enough reliable power for their energy needs.

Amazon and Google announced investments last October to help launch small nuclear reactors, technology still under development that the industry hopes will reduce the cost and timelines that have plagued new reactor builds in the U.S.

Meta issued a call in December for nuclear developers to submit proposals to help the tech company add up to four gigawatts of new nuclear in the U.S.

The pledge signed Wednesday was led by the World Nuclear Association on the sidelines of the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference in Houston.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j9japl/amazon_google_and_meta_support_tripling_nuclear/,1741783768.0

Qualcomm (QCOM.O), has also been pitched by TSMC, according to one of the sources and a separate source.

The talks, which are at an early stage, come after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration requested TSMC, the world's leading contract chipmaker, assist in turning around the troubled U.S. industrial icon, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the talks are not public.

The details of the plan for TSMC to take no more than a 50% stake and its overtures to potential partners are being reported for the first time.

Any final deal - the value of which is unclear - would need approval from the Trump administration, which does not want Intel or its foundry division to be fully foreign-owned, the sources said.

Intel, TSMC, Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm declined to comment. The White House and Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment.

At stake is the future of the U.S. chipmaking giant, whose shares have lost more than half of their value in the last year.

Intel reported a 2024 net loss of $18.8 billion, its first since 1986, driven by large impairments. The foundry division's property and plant equipment had a book value of $108 billion as of December 31, according to a company filing.

Intel stock rose more than 7% in premarket U.S. trading on Wednesday, while Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Qualcomm were up between 0.8% and 1.5%. TSMC closed about 1.8% higher in Taiwan.

Trump is keen to revive Intel's fortunes, as he seeks to boost American advanced manufacturing, three of the sources said.

The sources said TSMC's joint venture pitch was made to potential backers before the Taiwanese chipmaker announced with Trump on March 3 that the company planned to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States that involves building five additional chip facilities there in coming years.

Talks about the joint venture over Intel's foundry division have since continued, the three sources said, with TSMC looking to have more than one chip designer as a partner.

Multiple companies have expressed interest in buying parts of Intel, but two of the four sources said the U.S. company has rejected discussions about selling its chip design house separately from the foundry division.

Qualcomm has exited earlier discussions to buy all or part of Intel, according to those people and a separate source.

Intel board members have backed a deal and held negotiations with TSMC, while some executives are firmly opposed, according to two sources.

Intel's contract manufacturing business, or foundry division, was a crucial part of former CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to save Intel. Gelsinger was forced out by the board in December, which named two interim co-CEOs who have mothballed its forthcoming AI chip.

Any deals between historical rivals TSMC and Intel would face major challenges and be costly and laborious. The two companies currently use vastly different processes, chemicals, and chipmaking tool setups at their factories, according to separate sources at the companies.

Intel has previously had manufacturing partnerships with Taiwan's UMC (2303.TW), and Israel's Tower Semiconductor (TSEM.TA), that could offer a precedent for the two companies to operate together, but it remains unclear how such a partnership would work regarding trade manufacturing secrets.

The Taiwanese chipmaker wants potential investors in the joint venture to also be Intel advanced manufacturing customers, according to one of the sources.

Reuters reported last week, citing sources, that Nvidia and Broadcom are running manufacturing tests with Intel, using the company's most advanced production techniques, known as 18A. AMD is also evaluating whether Intel's 18A manufacturing process is suitable for it.

But 18A has been an area of contention in negotiations between Intel and TSMC, two sources said. During talks in February, Intel executives told TSMC that its advanced 18A manufacturing technology was superior to TSMC's 2-nanometer process, according to those sources.

1j9iwgp,EU Targets €26 Billion of US Products in Tariff Retaliation,">The European Union launched countermeasures on Wednesday against new US metals tariffs, with plans to impose its own duties on up to €26 billion ($28.3 billion) worth of American goods.

>The announcement came hours after the US administration imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in a massive escalation of the trade war between the longstanding allies. The EU will target politically sensitive goods in Republican-led states, including soybeans from Louisiana, home to House Speaker Mike Johnson, according to a senior EU official.

>EU metals tariffs that had been put in place during Trump’s first term, and later suspended, are due to be reintroduced in full on April 1, including some levies that have never previously been in force.

>The EU will also immediately begin consultations with member states, with the aim of adopting the additional lists of agricultural and industrial goods subject to tariffs as high as 25% by mid-April. Officials said the idea is to allow a window for negotiations, which will be led by the bloc’s trade chief, Maros Sefcovic.

>“The countermeasures we take today are strong yet proportionate,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters at a briefing in Strasbourg. “We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geo-economic and political uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with such tariffs.”

>While the EU announced immediately retaliatory steps, other affected countries, including the UK, refrained from immediate action and called for negotiations.

>European stocks rallied on Wednesday, with the Stoxx Europe 600 gaining 0.7% and Germany’s DAX rallying 1.2% as traders reacted to progress toward a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine. The euro was little changed, pausing after a sharp rally in the past days.

>For Europe, the new levies will be nearly four times the size of similar duties imposed during Trump’s first term, when the US targeted €6.4 billion of the bloc’s metals exports, citing national security concerns. The value of those previous levies is now €4.5 billion based on current EU-US trade volumes, according to an EU official.

>The EU will target US steel and aluminum products, as well as textiles, agricultural products and home appliances.

>For now, the EU plan is to penalize €22.5 billion of goods in total, an official said, although the bloc has the right to raise that to match the full €26 billion value of the US tariffs. It aims to target products that will inflict damage in politically sensitive places in the US while avoiding additional economic pain for Europe.

>The EU is planning to hit beef and poultry from Republican-led states Nebraska and Kansas, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The bloc’s list will include products from its previous trade fight with Trump such as boats, bourbon and motorbikes.

>The EU can begin sourcing some targeted products from outside the US, such as soybeans from Brazil or Argentina, according to the official.

>In addition, Trump has announced reciprocal tariffs coming in early April based on policies of partners that are seen as obstacles to US trade, including Europe’s value-added tax, and has targeted certain goods including European cars.

>Sefcovic traveled to Washington last month to try to find an amicable solution with senior members of the Trump team including US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. He offered to lower tariffs on industrial goods, including cars, one of Trump’s longstanding demands, and increasing US imports of liquefied natural gas and defense goods.

>“The disruption caused by tariffs is avoidable if the US administration accepts our extended hand and works with us to strike a deal,” Sefcovic said Wednesday. “We are ready to negotiate.”

>In the European steel market, producers are bracing for a two-fold impact, with European exports to the US set to fall, and the region’s imports set to rise as metal is re-routed away from the US.

>“We can indeed expect the EU market – already saturated with cheap steel imports from Asia, North Africa and the Middle East — to be further flooded as steel intended for the US market is redirected because of the new tariffs,” a spokesperson for industry lobby group Eurofer said.

>During the first Trump presidency, for every three tons of steel deflected from the US market because of tariffs, two tons went to the EU, the spokesperson said.

>Aluminum producers are also bracing for a surge in imports, particularly from Canada, which typically supplies more than half of the aluminum that the US imports.

>The metals tariffs apply worldwide, with effects extending to economic rivals as well as close US allies. Major Asian producers including South Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia held off on retaliating. The UK said it would focus on “rapidly negotiating a wider economic agreement.”

>For the EU, the fight over American metals tariffs started in 2018 during Trump’s first term, when the US hit steel and aluminum exports with duties, citing national security concerns. At the time, officials in Brussels scoffed at the notion that the EU posed such a threat.

>The 27-nation bloc retaliated by targeting politically sensitive companies with retaliatory duties, including Harley-Davidson Inc. motorcycles and Levi Strauss & Co. jeans.

>The two sides agreed to a temporary truce in 2021 under President Joe Biden, when the US partly removed its measures and introduced a set of tariff-rate quotas above which duties on the metals are applied, while the EU froze all of its restrictive measures.

1j9b08m,It’s official: US Imposes 25% Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum Imports,"President Donald Trump officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday, promising that the taxes would help create U.S. factory jobs at a time when his seesawing tariff threats are jolting the stock market and raising fears of an economic slowdown.

Trump removed all exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals, in addition to increasing the tariffs on aluminum from 10%. His moves, based off a February directive, are part of a broader effort to disrupt and transform global commerce. The U.S. president has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging “reciprocal” rates starting on April 2.

Trump told CEOs in the Business Roundtable on Tuesday that the tariffs were causing companies to invest in U.S. factories. The 8% drop in the S&P 500 stock index over the past month on fears of deteriorating growth appears unlikely to dissuade him, as Trump argued that higher tariff rates would be more effective at bringing back factories.

“The higher it goes, the more likely it is they’re going to build,” Trump told the group. “The biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That’s a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.”

A fresh flurry of trade-policy headlines touched off another volatile trading day on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 Index’s three-week selloff briefly reaching 10% before a late rally pared the drop.

The equity benchmark ended lower by 0.5%, after earlier falling as much as 1.5%. That had it on track to meet the accepted definition of a correction, which would be the first since late 2023. It is now trading at 5,572, compared with the record closing high of 6,144.15 it hit last month. Technology behemoths Apple Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Alphabet Inc. were among the biggest contributors to the index’s losses on the session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which entered its own correction on March 7, fell 0.2%.

As has been the case for the past three weeks, rapid-fire developments in Trump administration trade policy sent stocks on a wild ride Tuesday. President Donald Trump’s threat shortly after 10 a.m. to ratchet up tariffs on Canada touched off the day’s biggest swoon. Dip buyers stepped in when the index fell 10% from its record.

SNAP hasn't seen any 2 consecutive green daily candles since the Earnings Report.

Here is the good and bad news about SNAP:

Good News:

1. SNAP is likely to beat the upcoming earnings report expectations and become more profitable.
2. Price extremely low standing below 9 USD.
3. Due to China Tariffs, TikTok likely will not be sold to the US. Future Ad revenue from TikTok is likely to flow into SNAP and META.
4. SNAP has growing user base.
5. The company does not have political stance (Spiegel was not at Trump inauguration) It is unknown if Trump cares about the markets and the stocks/companies he talks about got negatively affected recently.
6. New Generative Video Announcement
7. 26% revenue increase in India

Bad News:

1. Executives are still selling the stock.
2. The company does not have any political stance. (Spiegel was not at Trump inauguration) Might keep going down because pro republican companies seem like they will be going up sooner.
3. The price is not going up despite being too low. It's almost as if SNAP got decoupled from the market and heading down on its own.
4. Oracle recently announced they would help Tiktok with the operations.

1j8zm0j,Global Value Investing in Our Era - Li Lu,"[**Global Value Investing in Our Era - Li Lu**](https://macro.com/app/pdf/4d4fdbe4-deb1-4235-a4a5-168ed11b984b?pdf_page_number=1&pdf_page_y=0)

**Main Takeaways:**

* The essence of wealth in modern society is the proportion of purchasing power within the economy, not static assets like land or cash. As a value investor, your goal should be to hold shares of the most dynamic companies in the most vibrant economies to preserve and grow your purchasing power globally.
* China's current economic challenges stem from its transition through the middle-income stage (what Li calls ""stage 2.5""), which is characterized by a significant mismatch between compound economic growth and slower evolution in social governance, human psychology, and political systems. The mismatch between rapid economic transformation and slower institutional evolution is not unique to China but a universal challenge faced by all countries during this transitional phase.
* A sound, complete capital market based on credibility is crucial for converting substantial savings into consumption and investment to drive economic growth. Hong Kong provides China with a historical opportunity similar to what the Netherlands offered Britain, as it already possesses all the elements of a modern capital market including legal systems, dispute resolution mechanisms, established intermediaries, and international trust.
* The distinction between ""virtual"" and ""real"" economies becomes obsolete as economies mature, as demonstrated by how companies like NVIDIA (considered part of the virtual economy) can exceed the combined market value of all publicly listed companies in major industrial nations. Such outdated dichotomy represents one of many conceptual paradigms that must evolve during economic transition to avoid hindering development.
* Value investing was born during periods of extreme macroeconomic turbulence, with founders like Ben Graham and John Maynard Keynes developing their methodologies during the Great Depression and World War II. Turbulent, confusing macro environments of such periods actually highlight the advantages of value investing, allowing practitioners to find significantly mispriced assets.
* China faces challenges in converting its high savings rate (around 50%) into consumption, as personal consumption accounts for only 40% of GDP compared to 60% in India and over 70% in the United States. Increasing the proportion of personal consumption in GDP remains crucial for achieving organic, self-perpetuated, sustainable economic growth, which represents the ultimate KPI of true modernization.
* The market economy stands as the greatest system invention in human history, transforming individual pursuit of self-interest into societal benefit through optimal resource allocation and continuous economic growth. Market economies have been repeatedly proven through various social experiments over the past centuries, and society need not criticize or deny these established consensuses or pay the price of violating common sense again.
* Six fundamental principles of value investing include: understanding stocks as ownership in companies, using Mr. Market to serve rather than guide you, ensuring sufficient margin of safety, staying within your circle of competence, ""fishing where the fish are,"" and recognizing wealth as proportion of purchasing power. Decades of practice by investors like Graham, Keynes, Buffett, Munger, and Li Lu himself have developed these principles.
* The economy functions as an interconnected chain of nodes, including entrepreneurial spirit, consumer confidence, bureaucratic incentives, foreign capital trust, and international relations. Every node serves as both ""chicken"" and ""egg"" (both cause and effect), meaning stimulating any node can ignite the entire economic chain, yet China's current challenge lies in the relative stagnation of all nodes.
* Value investors play a crucial role in the capital market by enabling its price discovery function and connecting valuable companies with individual savers. Without value investors who earn what they deserve, the capital market loses its effectiveness and can no longer turn savings into productive societal resources, making them indispensable partners to outstanding enterprises.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j8zm0j/global_value_investing_in_our_era_li_lu/,1741722140.0

Generac manufactures emergency power generators and is even the market leader, and could actually benefit greatly here, or what do you think?

I've put a small speculative position in the portfolio.

If one percent of the USA no longer had access to electricity, buying an emergency power generator would be extremely interesting for 3.4 million Americans.

But on Monday, amid a stock-market rout that drove the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index to its lowest level since September, investors added nearly $300 million to the ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK).

1j8wt2f,This is your reminder to not pay for or listen to any social media/instagram day trader course,"These people are today’s snake oil salesmen. They don’t actually make money from trading stocks, and it’s obvious why because if they were truly profitable and consistently beating the market, they wouldn’t be selling you a course or subscription to a trading channel. They’d be running their own nine or ten-figure hedge fund or managing billion-dollar+ accounts for big banks if they were truly profitable and yielding 30-100% returns daily like they advertise.

They’re not in it to “help the little guy” or “take control of their life.” Selling courses is just their business model—*you* are the product. Your purchase funds their lifestyle, not their trading success. Most of them rent luxury cars, penthouses, and business-class flights, piling up credit card debt to maintain the illusion of wealth. A few do make real money, but not from trading, just from selling the dream of financial freedom.

It’s an easy trap, especially for people struggling and down bad in life, as these people are the easiest to manipulate. The idea of making a fortune from home, being your own boss, and escaping the 9-to-5 is incredibly tempting. No one exploits that better than these so called “trading gurus.”

A prime example is Aristotle Investments, who preys on low-income African Americans who have zero on knowledge of derivatives, selling them the fantasy of overnight success with the riskiest asset class possible (options). Everything they do is a scam and meant to project and certain marketing image of success. All of these trading pages buy followers, pay for promotions on meme pages, clean up their Google search results, have bot armies for their comments and pay for Chinese bots to pump up video views. Their 'live trading' isn't real. EVERYTHING they do is a facade. Others, like Timothy Sykes, were among the first to popularize this scam. The truth is, anyone selling a day trading course (or any almost any course) on social media is a fraud. Ironically, most of them don’t even rely on trading themselves—they park their money in index funds, because that’s what actually works for anyone worth less than eight figures. There are actually decent pages run by people who have good intentions such as TheMarketHustle, who advertise simple methods of index investing which is what 99.99% of people should be listening to, not day trading options or even buying individual stocks. 

The scam has become so popular and oversaturated that now scammers are teaching others how to start their own social media day trading scam and sell courses themselves. There’s an entire market built around projecting an image on social media and selling bullshit courses of all sorts. It's people who refuse to get real jobs and instead make a living scamming others. It works because nothing sells harder than a dream, and there’s always someone desperate enough to believe it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j8wt2f/this_is_your_reminder_to_not_pay_for_or_listen_to/,1741715279.0

1j8vxgn,Trump's DOJ wants a Google breakup but is willing to leave AI alone,"President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.

But there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump’s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.

Backing off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was ""significant"" and ""very justified,"" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

It ""may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,"" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.

The stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.

The final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text.”

No matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.

Final remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.

It didn’t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.

""Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point,"" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.

It argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an “opportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google’s monopoly control.”

They also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.

But prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.

Anthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).

“Plaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google’s AI investments,” the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.

Derek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.

""They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,"" he said.

""I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.""

The tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.

""What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?” asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.

""It seems ill-timed to do that.""

The DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.

It asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox.

That is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.

Bernstein analysts have estimated Apple’s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.

Google countered the DOJ’s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default — so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.

McCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.

""Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,"" McCareins said.

1j8v68z,Waymo expands robotaxi service in Silicon Valley,"Waymo on Tuesday announced it is expanding its service to include another 27 square miles of coverage around the San Francisco Bay Area.

With the expansion, Waymo will now take passengers around Mountain View, Los Altos, Palo Alto and parts of Sunnyvale, California. The Alphabet-owned company opened its robotaxi service to the general public in San Francisco in June.

Waymo will initially limit the availability of its Silicon Valley service to users of the Waymo One app who are residents with ZIP codes in the area, the company said. Waymo plans to serve more riders across the region over time. The fleet of vehicles that will be in use in the new coverage areas are fully electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles with Waymo’s fifth generation of self-driving sensors, software and other technology.

“Opening our fully autonomous ride-hailing service in Silicon Valley marks a special milestone in our Bay Area journey,” Waymo product chief Saswat Panigrahi said in a statement. “This is where Waymo began and where we’re headquartered.”

Waymo expanded its San Francisco Bay Area robotaxi service last summer into Daly City, Broadmoor and Colma. Its robotaxis do not yet carry passengers to San Francisco International Airport.

A spokesperson told CNBC that Waymo is in “active discussions with SFO,” and added that the company is “working to connect” Silicon Valley and San Francisco to “provide seamless autonomous rides across more of the Bay Area in the future.”

Waymo also recently launched a commercial robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, just in time for the city’s annual South by Southwest festival.

While would-be competitors including Elon Musk’s automaker Tesla, and Amazon-owned Zoox, are continuing their own robotaxi testing and development, Waymo has pulled far ahead of self-driving companies in the U.S. 

Before Tuesday’s expansion, Waymo said it was serving more than 200,000 paid trips per week across San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix.

Alphabet doesn’t disclose financial results for the autonomous vehicle business, but Waymo is part of its “Other Bets.” That business unit generated $400 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and incurred operating losses of $1.17 billion, according to the company’s most recent financial filing.

Asana announced Moskovitz's upcoming departure on Monday as part of the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, and its board has retained an executive search firm to help choose a new CEO. Moskovitz notified its board ""of his intention to transition to the role of Chair when a new CEO begins,"" the company said Monday.

>""As I reflect on my journey since co-founding Asana nearly 17 years ago, I'm filled with immense gratitude,"" Moskovitz said in a statement. ""Creating and leading Asana has been more than just building a company — it's been a profound privilege to work alongside some of the most talented minds in the industry.""

>Asana said fourth-quarter sales rose 10% year over year to $188.3 million, which was in line with analysts' estimates. The company said its adjusted earnings per share was breakeven, ahead of analysts' estimates of a loss of one cent per share.

>Asana said it expects fiscal first-quarter revenue of $184.5 million to $186.5 million, trailing analysts' expectations of $191 million.

>Asana's stock price was down more than 25% in after-hours trading Monday.

>Moskovitz owns about 53% of the company's outstanding shares, between his Class A and Class B holdings. He has substantially increased his ownership since the company's public market debut in 2020.

By AGI I mean mostly the result of massive productivity gains in terms of coding or other office jobs. If you think about what this means for the tech sector, it would mean that the supply side will be massively flooded. Which means that the price will go down for software in general.

Or in concrete terms: If a few AI agents can code up reasonable complex software like a photo editor or excel, then people will exploit that instantly and try to sell it for cheaper than the existing products. If you can spent 10k in AI token to get 95% of photoshop, you could sell it for much cheaper than Adobes monthly sub.

The prices for all software and for everything than can be create with a computer will be driven down to a fraction of what they are now.

We've also seen a decently large move in the VIX (VXX) and we're close to above 60- I'm interested in shorting if we're above $60 but doubt we'll hit that today.

[**ASAN (Asana)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASAN&p=d)

CEO/co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz announced retirement. The company reported Q4 revenues of $188.3M, a 10% YoY increase, and issued a revenue outlook for fiscal 2026 below expectations (resulting in the drop).

That drop was close to 25%, mainly because Dustin owns close to 54% of the company, which signals a LOT of uncertainty and lack of faith in the company. Overall outlook is decently disappointing, and I'm mainly interested in it if we break $11.50 and very interested in buying $10.

**Ticker:** [**AAL (American Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAL&p=d)

AAL projected a higher-than-expected Q1 loss and revised its revenue outlook downward, attributing the weaker forecast to softness in the domestic leisure segment. This is probably amplified by fears of flying, mainly due to people being terrified of all the plane accidents that have happened in 2025. Recession fears also lead to people cutting their vacations/discretionary spending and saving money, so things may get worse. Overall we're seeing a slight recovery in the premarket but still watching to see how this trades. To me airlines are one of the bigger leading signals of economic uncertainty so will continue watching. Other tickers that have moved on this are DAL, UAL, LUV.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j8qi84/these_are_the_stocks_on_my_watchlist_0311/,1741699031.0

And I'm wondering if anyone has insight into it's status quo now? My thinking was the inflationary tariffs may give Upstart some more business opportunity with the likely increased consumer debt.  Or is there more at play?

1j8ou9u,Amateur investor curious about the returns from learning investment strategy,"So, just to kick off, let me get the obvious out of the way:  I know knowledge is power so there isn't any drawback to knowing more. 

Background:  I'm a full time employee who took 5 figures of savings and was fortunate to take them to 6 figures during covid.  I mostly did this by only researching the absolute basics of investing (different types of investments, terminology, dollar cost averaging, risk reward stuff and downside protection), coupled with diligence in waking up early to read news and trade, gut feelings and intuition, and a good dose of luck. I'm mostly a long term trader atm with a smaller portion of my portfolio in speculation stocks. 

I also understand the phrase ""every investor is a genius after a crash"" or to that point.   Since the 2020-2021 crazy runups I've sold most of my risky stuff and parked 90% of my port in blue chips, dividends, and the like. My goal is to generate enough passive income to free up time. 

Now to the meat:  The current market doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me. Stocks go down on good news, up on bad news, companies with giga low EPS seem to have massively bloated market caps, and generally, outside of the general turmoil of global and Trump politics, stocks seem to behave in a way i often can't fully understand. A lot of finance jargon is dropped in forums and news stories that i don't always fully understand. I'd like to have more ammo to bring to the table for stocks in general, but especially mid cap speculations.

So my questions are

1 - is it generally worth my time to take a course or read lots on advanced investment strategies as a blue collar?  Or should i simply keep it simple?

2 - if it is worth it, what are good and affordable books, resources, or online courses i could take?

3 - is the stock market just a different beast today than it was 30 years ago, IE has AI, online retail investors, dark pools and other tomfoolery just made speculation stocks too crazy to understand?

1j8hp9q,Bottom Is Near,"Weirdly seeing a barrage of dooms day recession post that just reminded me of Aug 2024 and how everyone thinks recession is here.

Just a reminder that every year there's a 10% Sp500 correction typically associated with some sort of recession fear in the FUTURE. We had it in Aug 2024 when we had nonfarm payroll print 12k, which was a hard economic data that actually showed the econ was very close to or already in a recession. The Fed then proceeded to cut 50 basis points, and it turned out to be data noise. We also had one in Sept 2023 when people thought the Fed was gonna go overboard with the rate hikes and engineer a recession.

Today, we have actual fairly strong econ data. Nonfarm payroll solidly around 150-200k, GDP around 1.5-2%. Even if Trump tariffs hold, most economists anticipate it to subtract 0.5-1% from GDP growth, and add 0.5-1% to PCE. That is a weak economy, a little closer to a 0% GDP than we want, but certainly NOT a recession, and that's IF all of Trump tariffs hold.

If you listen to what most professional economists are saying, not that they're correct all the time, most are simply revising up their recession probabilities from 15-20% to 25-30% (the lowest the probability can be is 15% by the way). For them to forecast a recession as their BASE CASE, the probability has to be around 65%, which is what happened in late 2022, and even then we didn't get a recession.

Furthermore, Powell and the Fed have demonstrated that they are way more concerned about recession risks than inflation risks. The fact that they are willing to tolerate above 2.0% inflation for years, continuously moving the deadline from 2024 to 2027, shows this. In Sep 2024, they were willing to surprise the market and start the rate cuts at 50 basis points as a pre-emptive measure, when the economy was clearly fine. Just last Friday, Powell didn't even show any sign of concern about recession risk. So if you're concerned that a recession is imminent, it's really not. You can listen to any economist talk about this.

What is happening is the RISK of recession has increased, and the market has to price in a higher probability of recession accordingly, leading to the decline. Uncertainty has also increased, and market also has to price in some premiums for uncertainty. That's what leading to the drop, which can quickly reverse.

So if you're feeling worried, I suggest you look at SP500 history, see when the 8-10% corrections happened in the last several years, and see what kind of posts/discussions occurred near the bottom of those corrections. As of today, SP500 has corrected 10% overnight, and I think the bottom is pretty much here, or very near.

Whether or not a recession will happen in the next 6-12 months is undecided, but SP500 typically doesn't start pricing that in until it's right at the doorstep.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j8hp9q/bottom_is_near/,1741663851.0

1j8fi18,Oracle misses on earnings and issues weak revenue guidance,"Oracle issued quarterly results on Monday that trailed analysts’ estimates and gave a forecast that came up short of expectations.

Here is how Oracle did compared to LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $1.47 adjusted vs. $1.49 expected
* **Revenue:** $14.13 billion vs. $14.39 billion expected

Revenue increased 6% from $13.3 billion in the same period last year. Net income rose 22% to $2.94 billion, or $1.02 a share, from $2.4 billion, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in Oracle’s cloud services business jumped 10% from a year earlier to $11.01 billion, accounting for 78% of total sales.

The company’s cloud infrastructure segment, which helps businesses move workloads out of their own data centers, has been booming due to demand for computing power that can support artificial intelligence projects. Oracle said revenue in its cloud infrastructure unit increased 49% from a year earlier to $2.7 billion.

“We are on schedule to double our data center capacity this calendar year,” Oracle Chair Larry Ellison said in a release. “Customer demand is at record levels.”

In January, President Donald Trump announced plans to invest billions of dollars in AI infrastructure in the U.S. in collaboration with Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank. The first initiative of the joint venture, called Stargate, will be to construct data centers in Texas, an effort that is already underway, Ellison said during the announcement at the White House.

Oracle said it has more than $130 billion in remaining performance obligations after signing $48 billion in contracts during the period. That excludes contracts related to Stargate, Oracle CEO Safra Catz said on the call with analysts.

Oracle will spend around $16 billion in capital expenditures this year, which is a little more than double the total from last year, Catz added.

“As always, we remain careful to pace and align our CapEx investments appropriately and in line with booking trends,” Catz said.

For the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue to grow of between 8% and 10%. Analysts were expecting growth of about 11% to $15.91 billion, according to LSEG. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $1.61 to $1.65 per share. Analysts were calling for adjusted earnings per share of $1.79.

Catz said Oracle’s fourth quarter adjusted earnings projections were negatively impacted by losses from an investment in another company.

Oracle’s cloud and on-premises licenses business contributed $1.1 billion in revenue during the quarter, down 10% year over year.

The company also said it is increasing its quarterly dividend to 50 cents a share from 40 cents.

As of Monday’s close, Oracle’s stock is down almost 11% year to date.

1j8fg5d,Tech megacaps lose over $750 billion in market cap in worst day for Nasdaq since 2022,"It’s gone from bad to worse for tech investors.

With the Nasdaq suffering its steepest drop since 2022 on Monday, the seven most valuable tech companies lost more than $750 billion in market value. Recession fears and concerns about a trade war drove the selloff.

Apple led the megacap losses, with its value plummeting by about $174 billion. Nvidia shaved off almost $140 billion in market value and shares closed down 5%. The leading AI chipmaker has lost nearly a third of its value just two months after notching a fresh high in January.

Tesla had the biggest percentage loss, with shares of the electric vehicle maker tumbling 15%, their worst day since 2020. The company has lost more than half its value since its stock price peaked in mid-December**.** The stock is also coming off its longest weekly losing streak in history as a public company.

Tesla lost $130 billion in value on Monday, while Microsoft and Alphabet lost $98 billion and $95 billion, respectively. Amazon lost $50 billion and Meta lost $70 billion.

Alphabet and Meta dropped more than 4% on Monday, while Microsoft and Amazon dropped at least 2% each. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell more than 4%, entering correction territory. Shares are more than 14% off their high.

Heavy selling intensified across the tech, with the Nasdaq falling to a six-month low. Many tech companies rely on parts and manufacturing overseas and new levies could push up prices. That’s also sparked worries of a U.S. recession, which Trump didn’t rule out over the weekend.

Semiconductor makers have also felt the pain, with the sector a primary target of new tariffs. Last week, the president announced an additional $100 billion investment from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and called the company the “most powerful” in the world as he looks to boost domestic production.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF has plunged 3% over the past week and is down more than 16% since the inauguration. Heavy selling rattled the sector again Monday, with the ETF last down roughly 5%. Marvell Technology shed 8%, while ASML Holding and Micron Technology slumped more than 6% each. Broadcom fell 5%.

1j8er2r,"Why I Wouldn’t Bet on an Inflation Fuled, Tariff Induced Recession","The prevailing wisdom is that Trump’s tariff negotiations are going to tank the economy and cause a recession and stagflation. I’m here to argue, inflation is dead and whatever this is, is looking like a regular recession.

1. Commodity prices

There is no better gauge of future inflation than the actual prices people are paying for inputs.

DBC Commodity ETF - downtrend since July of 2022

2. 1 Year Inflation Expectations - 2.73%

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXPINF1YR

The market doesn’t see it despite it being “so obvious”

3. Long Term Bonds

TLT is up 4% YTD, rallied strong today. In 2022 TLT was clobbered as inflation was driving rates higher

4. Inflation Nowcast 2-3% annual depending on various measures

https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-nowcasting

The only major data point I can find where inflation has legs is in the precious metals markets. Been in an uptrend since market lows in 2022.

If we think inflation will continue to drop and the economy will slow, we should expect bonds to finally be back.

At this point, tariffs are well understood and even expected, yet none of the inflation numbers have turned. While I’m not saying we will or won’t have a recession, I’m simply saying the narrative of tarries causing inflation causing a recession doesn’t seem to match the data.

**Tesla Brand Damage**  
Tesla is Musk.  His comments in the media and related actions with DOGE have deeply hurt the Tesla brand.  If you look at Tesla's core audience it is left leaning, environmentally conscious Democrats.   Musks actions have completely alienated that demographic.   The Republicans aren't buying EV's and certainly not enough to offset a loss from the left.   A close analogy would be Bud Light and Trans Activist Dylan Mulvaney.   Sales dropped 30% and still haven't fully recovered.   Bud Light eventually fired the executives responsible for the campaign.   But there is next to 0 chance the Tesla Board jettisons Musk, as he has stacked the board with family members and loyalists.

Antidotally, I live in the Bay Area.  My social circle is left leaning White Collar professionals, Tesla's key demographic, and talking with co-workers/friends I don't know anybody who is planning to buy a Tesla.   I have some friends who have Tesla's but when their lease is up they don't plan on renewing or buying another one.   In my view Musk's political activism has permanently harmed the Tesla Brand.

  
**Valuation**  
Tesla EPS was $2.05 last year and currently trades at a P/E ratio of 108.  For comparison Toyota trades at a P/E ration of 7, Ford 6, and Mercedes at 5.    Stocks can trade at high P/E ratios based on rosy growth rates.   Musk has long touted that Tesla is an AI and RoboTaxi company, it's part of why Tesla trades at such lofty valuations.   However, I checked Tesla's 10k and 90% of their revenue comes from Automotive and Automotive Services.   They are very much a car company.       

Even if you were to say Tesla deserves a premium valuation of 20x earnings, that would put a valuation of \~$41, which is a sharp drop from where it currently trades at $222.15.   Yes, Tesla is a Meme Stock and traditional valuation metrics don't apply (i.e Gamestop).   But here's the rub.   Automotive companies have huge fixed costs.   Those factories and plants, cost a lot to build and finance.   A large drop in sales can get ugly real fast and generate huge losses.   There's no way to justify these lofty valuations when your sales are dropping and your company starts hemorrhaging  money.  At some point the illusion cracks.

1j8bbhl,"Tesla shares plunge 15%, suffering steepest drop in five years","Tesla’s sell-off on Wall Street intensified on Monday, with shares of the electric vehicle maker plunging 15%, their worst day on the market since September 2020.

On Friday, Tesla wrapped up a seventh straight week of losses, its longest losing streak since debuting on the Nasdaq in 2010. The stock has fallen every week since CEO Elon Musk went to Washington, D.C., to take on a major role in the second Trump White House.

Since peaking at $479.86 on Dec. 17, Tesla shares have lost more than 50% of their value, wiping out upward of $800 billion in market cap. Monday marked the stock’s seventh worst day on record.

Tesla led a broader slump in U.S. equities, with the Nasdaq tumbling almost 4%, its steepest decline since 2022.

The downdraft in Tesla’s stock on Monday was tied to uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s plans on tariffs. Canada and Mexico are key markets for automotive suppliers, and increased tariffs, with the potential for a trade war, will likely affect production and lead to higher prices.

Tesla is also dealing with brand erosion due to Musk’s incendiary political rhetoric and his extensive work with the Trump administration, where he is leading up the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Musk, the world’s wealthiest person, has become the public face of the administration’s effort to dramatically shrink the federal government’s workforce, spending and capacity.

Meanwhile, Musk has used his social network X to level accusations against judges whose decisions he did not like and promoted false Kremlin talking points about Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Activists and former Musk fans have protested at Tesla facilities across the U.S., and Tesla vehicles and facilities have been the apparent targets of vandalism and arson attempts. Repeated arson attempts and instances of vandalism occurred at a Tesla store and service center in Loveland, Colorado, most recently on March 7, police told CNBC.

Ben Kallo, an analyst at Baird, told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Monday that recent reports of vandalism could hurt demand.

“When people’s cars are in jeopardy of being keyed or set on fire out there, even people who support Musk or are indifferent Musk might think twice about buying a Tesla,” Kallo said.

Analysts at Bank of America’s wrote in a report on Monday that Tesla’s new vehicle sales plummeted about 50% in Europe in January from a year earlier, partly owing to growing distaste for the brand. The firm also noted that some prospective customers are waiting for the new version of the Model Y.

Tesla’s Model Y, which is a small SUV, remained the best-selling battery electric vehicle globally in January. It was followed by China’s Geely Geome, which surpassed the Tesla Model 3 sedan for the month.

Global sales of electric vehicles, including fully electric and plug-in hybrid models, increased 21% in January from a year ago, even as Tesla’s sales declined. The growth was driven by demand in Europe, according to Bank of America.

1j8aimn,Trump set to meet with Wall st execs and Top CEOs on Tuesday,"Donald Trump meeting with top CEOs and Wall Street executives on Tuesday, March 11, 2025, comes at a time when the stock market is jittery—$1.75 trillion wiped out, recession odds climbing to 39%, and uncertainty over tariffs shaking investor confidence. The Business Roundtable meeting is a chance for Trump to pitch his economic vision directly to the heavy hitters of American business. How this affects the stock market, and why it might actually be a good thing, depends on a few key factors.

How It Could Affect the Stock Market
1. **Short-Term Volatility**: Markets hate uncertainty, and right now, Trump’s tariff policies are a big question mark. If he doubles down on aggressive tariffs during this meeting—say, sticking to the 25% on Canada and Mexico or the 20% on China—stocks could take another hit. Investors might see it as a signal of prolonged trade wars, higher costs for companies, and squeezed consumer spending. The S&P 500, already down 8.5% from its February peak (per Reuters data from today), could slide further, especially in sectors like tech and retail that rely on global supply chains.

2. **Confidence Boost (or Bust)**: If Trump uses this meeting to clarify his plans—maybe signaling flexibility on tariffs or emphasizing tax cuts and deregulation—markets could rally. CEOs and Wall Street execs want predictability. A strong, coherent message about long-term growth could calm nerves and reverse some of the selloff. But if he’s vague or combative, expect more panic selling.

3. **Sector-Specific Impacts**: Certain industries might react differently. Financials and energy could benefit if Trump pushes deregulation and domestic focus, while multinationals and importers (think Walmart or Target) might lag due to tariff fears. The Nasdaq, already down over 4% today, is especially vulnerable given its tech-heavy weighting and those “extended valuations” analysts are worried about.
Why It Could Be a Good Thing
1. **Resetting Expectations**: The market’s been running on fumes of post-election hype—lower taxes, less regulation, the “Trump trade.” This meeting could force a reality check. A selloff now might flush out overinflated valuations (like in tech) and set the stage for a healthier climb later. Think of it as a painful but necessary detox, as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at recently.

2. **Long-Term Focus**: Trump’s doubling down on “long-term economic strength” suggests he’s willing to weather short-term turbulence for bigger gains—like bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. If CEOs buy into this and signal support, it could shift investor sentiment from fear to patience. A $1.75 trillion wipeout sounds brutal, but markets often overreact; the S&P 500’s still up historically over longer horizons.

3. **Bargaining Power**: Tariffs might just be a negotiation tactic. If Trump convinces CEOs he’s using them to extract better trade deals (not crash the economy), Wall Street might see it as a win. Lower bond yields—already dropping today—could ease borrowing costs, helping businesses and consumers down the line. Plus, a weaker dollar (contrary to textbook tariff effects) could boost U.S. exports, offsetting some pain.

The Catch
It’s not all rosy. Recession fears aren’t baseless—consumer confidence is tanking, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model predicts a Q1 2025 contraction, and layoffs are creeping up. If Trump’s meeting flops—say, he clashes with CEOs or doubles down on chaos—those 39% recession odds could jump fast. Markets might not give him the benefit of the doubt like they did in his first term when the “Trump put” was a thing.

Bottom Line
The stock market’s immediate reaction will hinge on Trump’s tone and clarity tomorrow. More uncertainty = more selling; a strong, unifying pitch = potential rebound. Why it’s good? It could force a needed correction and align markets with a longer-term vision, assuming Trump’s not bluffing about strength. But it’s a gamble—39% recession odds aren’t trivial, and CEOs might not be in the mood for vague promises.

1j88vsv,Possible recession,"So, the yield curve is fully inverted now, with the 10-year bond yield sitting above the 3-month yield. Historically, this has been a 100% accurate predictor of recessions. Every single time we’ve seen this inversion last for a significant period, a recession followed. The only exceptions were in 1967 and 1998, where the inversion was relatively short-lived, and while growth slowed, the economy didn’t officially enter a recession.

That said, the economy has been holding up surprisingly well despite the red flags. Inflation hasn’t surged even with the added pressure of tariffs, though GDP has taken a hit—largely because American companies stacked up on inventories earlier, reducing net exports. And then there’s the job market, which seems to be the key factor in all of this.

If we look at 1967 and 1998, jobless claims remained stable despite the inversion, which likely prevented a full-blown recession. In contrast, during past recessions, jobless claims spiked right alongside the yield curve inversion. Right now, everything really hinges on how the labor market evolves—if we start seeing a major uptick in jobless claims and deeper labor market polarization, then a recession becomes much more likely.

The wildcard is what (DOGE? lol) does. If they manage to navigate this without spooking the labor market, we could dodge a recession like in ’67 and ’98. But if unemployment starts creeping up meaningfully, history suggests we’re in for some rough times ahead.

1j81lye,RDDT in Freefall - What's the long term outlook?,"Woof. This stock is down about 40% in a single month since their last earnings and shows no signs of stopping.

From my understanding, the drop has been driven by a few key factors:

* **Missed user growth expectations** (101.7M DAUs vs. 103.1M expected)
* **Insider selling en masse** (Execs dumping millions in shares last month)
* **General market sell off & post-IPO volatility**

At the same time, Reddit is a **top 10 website in the world** for web traffic, has been rapidly increasing ad revenue, and is now *wildly* undervalued compared to other social media giants. 

So the real question is... what's next?

* Is this an absolute bargain right now, or is there still more room to fall? 
* Could Reddit be the next Facebook, or is it doomed to be another Snap? 
* What would be a solid buy-in price to you?

I've bought about £100 worth at $171 so thank fuck I didn't load up more. Once the dust settles, I think long term I'm going to be loading up a bit as I think people are probably grossly underestimating the amount of cash they'll rake in through their paid subs (onlyfans promoters will go wild for them to be separated from the floods of bots).

That being said, the wider economic outlook isn't great (although I don't see how recession or tariffs should impact RDDT at all outside of less people looking to advertise).

It seems unlikely to end up like SNAP since they're already profitable (unlike SNAP).

1j7zu9j,MicroStrategy Announces $21B Preferred Stock Offering Paying 8% a Year,"TYSONS CORNER, Va., March 10, 2025—Strategy™ (Nasdaq: MSTR; STRK) today announced that it has entered into a sales agreement pursuant to which Strategy may issue and sell shares of its 8.00% series A perpetual strike preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “perpetual strike preferred stock”), having an aggregate offering price of up to $21.0 billion (the “ATM Program”). Shares of the perpetual strike preferred stock are convertible by the holders into shares of Strategy’s class A common stock.
Strategy expects to make sales of perpetual strike preferred stock pursuant to the ATM Program in a disciplined manner over an extended period, taking into account the trading price and trading volumes of the perpetual strike preferred stock at the time of sale. 

Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from the ATM Program for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital.
The perpetual strike preferred stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, may be sold by agents by any method that is deemed an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or any other method permitted by law, which may include negotiated transactions or block trades.

1j7zt3d,"Hypothetically, at what point WOULD you panic?","This is a doom and gloom scenario post.  Please leave now if you aren't in the mood for it.

I'm 50, and have been investing since the mid '90s.  I've witnessed my share of ""the sky is falling"" sentiments.  I've learned to stay calm thru those periods and benefit from the boom that eventually follows.  

However, nothing lasts forever.  If there ever was leadership to end this gravy train, it would be this one.  At what point would you be convinced (and obviously it's not anywhere close to where we are) that this time is not like the other times -- and that it's truly a sinking ship?

1j7zm8c,Why the 2025 Bear Market is the real deal & only just getting started,"When it comes to recent major market corrections, the largest drops have coincided with the loosening of interest rates. There have been market corrections outside of these periods, however, those events are significantly lesser in scope compared to the current analog situations of 2000, 2008, and 2020. 

The Fed Funds rate was held at 6.5% from June 2000 to December 2000. It was 5.25 from July of 2006 to July of 2007. It was 2.4 between January of 2019 and July of 2019. 

As the Fed began cutting rates, in each situation, the market began to decline. However, it was during these declines that illiquidity events took place, causing major panic, and subsequent cratering of markets. 

The 1-point decline in interest rates from peak coincides with February 2001, December 2007, and November of 2019. Each respective recession officially began in March of 2001, December of 2007, and February 2020. 

We hit 1-point below peak in January. There is a strong possibility we are ALREADY in recession, however, genius economists will only tell us this in a year or two. 

In any case, each of these recessions coincided with feat contagion and general panic. Each of these events also bottomed after major catastrophes - in 2000 it was 9/11 and Enron, in 2008 it was Lehman + subprime crisis, in 2019 it was.... that horrible thing that we no longer talk about. 

We are already in the fear stage of the market. 2000's panic was a general meltdown PRIOR to the crises that later unfolded. However, it was those crises that marked its bottom. 2008 and 2020's craterings occurred simultaneous to their crises although stocks did drift down prior to 2008 as well. 

This begs the question: what is the crisis that may or may not occur with the cyclical correction that happens as the Fed cuts rates EVERY cycle? Will it be a true black swan no-one saw coming (9/11) or will it be something like Enron, Lehman, or COVID, where some DID see what was coming ahead of the general panic?

Could TSLA be the Enron of the 2025 bust? It is seeming more and more plausible with each passing day. In any case, the bottom of the market in each of the aforementioned cases occurred simultaneous to the Fed funds rate hitting 0 (or almost 0 in 2003). I expect shelter contribution to CPI to vanish in the next few reports + unemployment to rise significantly, this could give the Fed leeway to put rates back to 0 as soon as Q3-Q4 2025. In both 2009 and 2020 the Fed rate hit 0 when annualized CPI did the same (in March), and March of both years also coincided with their respective market bottoms. 

TLDR; we are far from the bottom, which should occur when Fed Funds hit 0, buy when that happens but before that point, gird your loins.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j7zm8c/why_the_2025_bear_market_is_the_real_deal_only/,1741616166.0

News: [Rocket Companies To Buy Real Estate Firm Redfin](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/10/rocket-companies-to-buy-real-estate-firm-redfin.html)

**Ticker:** [**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** MSTR has announced an At-The-Market (ATM) program to sell up to $21B of its 8.00% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock.

**Technicals:** Watching $275 level, but with all the bearishness in the CC market recently... biased short but no position.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** This is basically an offering. This doesn't dilute common stock but creates a new layer of obligation in the cap structure. Creates a dividend obligation of 8% a year that MSTR might struggle to pay going forward without selling some of their holdings.

**Risks:** The underlying CC price is what will determine if this is a good deal or not in the future.

**Related Tickers:** COIN, HOOD, and other CC related stocks.

**Ticker:** [**RKT (Rocket Mortgage)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT&p=d)**,** [**RDFN (Redfin)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RDFN&p=d)

**Catalyst:** RKT has agreed to acquire real estate firm RDFN in an all-stock transaction valued at $1.75B.

**Technicals:** Each share of Redfin common stock will be exchanged for a fixed ratio of 0.7926 shares of Rocket Companies Class A common stock (so represents roughly 7% at the time of this edit)

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Supposedly there'll be +$200M in synergy (when the value of the two companies is higher than when they're not), through technology improvements and AI (lol). Deal expected to close in second/third quarter.

**Risks:** The deal is in all stock (which is likely why RKT fell, but expect RKT to gain if the deal is cancelled), so signals some uncertainty and that RKT is overvalued for now. Also remember that we're in a correction right now.

**Related Tickers:** Z

**Ticker:** [**NVO (Novo Nordisk)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVO&p=d)

**Catalyst:** NVO released Phase 3 trial results for its next-generation weight loss drug, CagriSema, which showed 15.7% average weight loss over 68 weeks, below 25% target.

**Technicals:** This stock can't catch a break. Watching to see if we break the $75 level. Remember there was similar news back in December 20th.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The obesity drug market is highly competitive, LLY has Zepbound, which is a major competitor that performs better - so the market is questioning what the point of CagriSema is if it can't outperform.

**Related Tickers:** LLY, PFE, SNY

**Ticker:** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)

**Catalyst:** SP500 has decided not to include COIN in the index during their latest review.

**Technicals:** Watching $200 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** All the people that bought on hype/expectation that this will be included will sell/pare their position. Changes occur roughly every 3 months. The underlying CC has been on a downturn and there's no large catalyst that we can expect (the White House Summit was a bust IMO) so overall a negative catalyst.

**Risks:** I frankly see a warning signal being flashed by MSTR (mentioned earlier).

just stumpled across this news which has been published a few minutes ago. That should affect the share price very positive today, doesnt it?

In total, over 31% of the outstanding shares will be bought back.

The reason: Perion remains convinced that it will generate strong free cash flows in the near future and that the share price is currently significantly undervalued.

Extremely positive: Perion is swimming in money, so to speak, and can finance these buybacks from its cash reserves without taking dept.

How do you think about the effects to the share price?

Here is the official news:



Perion Expands its Current Share Repurchase Program to a Total of $125 Million

PERION, a leader in advanced technology solving for the complexities of modern advertising, announced today that its Board of Directors authorized a $50 million expansion of the previously authorized share repurchase program of $75 million of its outstanding shares, to a total of $125 million. 

As of December 31, 2024, the company repurchased a total of 5.2 million shares, at a total amount of $46.8 million. 

The expansion of the program is subject to the issuance of the Company's audited annual financial report for the year 2024.
""The expansion of our share repurchase program reflects and reinforces our confidence in our ability to continue to generate positive free cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet,"" said Tal Jacobson, Perion's CEO. 

""We believe that the current share price does not reflect the strength of Perion's business and the value of our strategic evolution to Perion One.
Perion has a market cap of $400 million and has just announced that it will increase its buyback program from $75 million by another $50 million (12.5% ​​of the market cap) to a total of $125 million.

Finance noob here, so forgive the stupid question.

I've been looking at earning calendars and reported EPS a lot recently and have been using the Nasdaq for a fair amount of research on companies. However, when researching I have found that Nasdaq has different EPS numbers compared to other websites such as [investing.com](http://investing.com) or zacks.com...

Example: Nasdaq says ORCL's reported EPS last quarter was 1.15 and reported EPS this quarter last year it was 1.12. source: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/orcl/earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/orcl/earnings)

1j7n8rq,ACM Research (ACMR) – A Hidden Gem in the Semiconductor Space?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve recently started looking into ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR), and I find it pretty fascinating! Despite the overall market turmoil, ACMR seems to have gained some solid momentum lately. With its position in the booming semiconductor industry, I can’t help but feel optimistic about its potential.

**Company Overview:**  
ACM Research develops and sells capital equipment, focusing on wet cleaning tools for semiconductor manufacturing. Their innovations, like the Ultra C Tahoe cleaning tool, are gaining traction in a market that’s increasingly competitive. Just recently, they reported a 60% jump in stock price following a strong earnings announcement, with net income rising to $104 million and revenue hitting $782 million.

**Key Stats:**

* **Market Cap:** $1.17B
* **Forward P/E:** 12.59
* **Quarterly Revenue Growth:** 31.20%
* **Cash:** $444M (Debt: $188.78M)
* **Profit Margin:** 13.25%

Despite the broader market's fluctuations, ACMR has delivered a remarkable 188% return over the past five years. Their ability to maintain revenue guidance for 2025 between $850 million and $950 million is also reassuring.

**Discussion Points:**

1. With the semiconductor sector facing volatility, do you think ACMR can maintain its growth trajectory?
2. How do you view their recent earnings performance in the context of the current economic climate?
3. What are your thoughts on their innovations and how they might impact their market position?
4. Are there any risks or concerns you see that could affect ACMR's future?

1j7lnlh,Trump does not rule out recession as he rejects business fears over tariffs,"https://www.ft.com/content/d7d2f3f4-d681-4a3a-974c-ff2885e98663



	


Donald Trump has declined to rule out either a recession or higher inflation while dismissing the concerns of business over a lack of clarity on tariffs, after a tumultuous week in which he watered down elements of his aggressive trade agenda. 

The president insisted industry had “plenty of clarity” and lashed out at “soundbite[s]” from companies expressing confusion over his plans. 

“They always say that — that’s like almost a soundbite — they always say that: ‘we want clarity’,” Trump said in an interview aired on Fox News on Sunday. 

“It sounds good to say, but for years, the globalists, the big globalists, have been ripping off the United States. They’ve been taking money away from the United States, and all we’re doing is getting some of it back.”

The president declined to rule out a recession hitting the US economy this year after the Atlanta Fed warned of an economic contraction in the first quarter of the year. 

“I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing, and there are always periods, it takes a little time.”

Asked whether tariffs could fuel inflation again, Trump said: “You may get it. In the meantime, guess what? Interest rates are down.”

The comments come after a week of about-turns and an equity market sell-off as markets scrambled for clarity over Trump’s brewing trade war and companies warned of rising prices.

The president imposed 25 per cent tariffs across the board on imports from Canada and Mexico on Tuesday before backtracking later in the week.

On Wednesday he granted carmakers a carve-out from the levies and on Thursday extended that to all goods that met the rules of the 2020 USMCA free-trade deal. Separate 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports are set to take effect this week.

The levies have already caused significant upheaval in the market as companies stockpile materials, review operations and prepare to raise prices. Trump reiterated that the tariffs could rise in future.

“The tariffs could go up as time goes by. They may go up, I don’t know if it’s predictability,” he said.

Trump said in the interview that he had “wanted to help the American carmakers” this week but insisted that no such leeway would be shown on reciprocal tariffs set to be imposed next month. 

“I gave them a little bit of a break for a short period of time . . . It’s a transition into April, and after that I’m not doing this . . . I told them, I said: Look, I’m going to do it this one time but, after that, I’m not doing it.”

Separately on Sunday, Howard Lutnick, Trump’s commerce secretary, conceded some of the tariffs would cause inflationary pressures, echoing Trump’s warnings of “a little disturbance” when he addressed Congress on Tuesday.

“So, will there be distortions? Of course, foreign goods may get a little more expensive, but American goods are going to get cheaper.,” Lutnick told NBC’s meet the press.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j7lnlh/trump_does_not_rule_out_recession_as_he_rejects/,1741565236.0
1j7l0bv,TSLA being investigated by Transport Canada for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars.,"The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653 Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today. However I do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it’s an overall market pull back from trade wars and from Europe sales declines. The article was published Friday morning and Tesla was up 3% by end of Friday.

**HWM** Started in Week 0 at 136.25 and came off Tuesday this week at its 10% trailing stop, $126.49.  Down 7.2% in its 3 weeks.  

**SAP**, *last* Monday's replacement pick: 287.40 to 276.80, -3.7% in 10 trading days.  

**GLD** 265.07 to 268.39, up 1.2% in 5 trading days.

But reports are coming that Ukraine is making the transition to Eutelsat;

*The Armed Forces of Ukraine began the transition to Eutelsat Konnect VHTS One Web.*  
*Speed up to 195 Mbps*  
*Ping 70 ms. The full transition will take a month. After that, all contracts with the starlink will be broken.*

Italy is also not happy and may abandon its largest contract for Starlink satellite communications services.  
The €1.5 billion deal is increasingly raising questions in Giorgia Meloni's government. Italian officials believe that they should no longer rely on American companies and billionaire Elon Musk, who is close to the US leadership, for security.

*Goldman has raised its 12-month price target to €6.7 from €1.0, though this still implies 3% downside from the last closing price. The firm expects continued share price volatility until there is greater clarity on government contract formations with Eutelsat.*

The stock has grown almost 200% over last 2 years. The company is paying nice dividend, but I don’t know if it is still a great investment. Would the stock growth even more? Or should I wait till better entry point?

1j783xl,LUNR - Athena is dead,"Athena is dead link: [https://www.space.com/the-universe/moon/private-intuitive-machines-moon-lander-fell-over-inside-crater-at-lunar-south-pole-photo-reveals](https://www.space.com/the-universe/moon/private-intuitive-machines-moon-lander-fell-over-inside-crater-at-lunar-south-pole-photo-reveals) . I was invested in this company and made a decent amount of money off of them, until now. Probably slightly red after Thursday and ultimately selling Friday morning.  

After having watched the Athena lander try to land on Thursday morning, and watching my a reasonable amount of money die with it, it was a moment for reflection for this company, and really any others.  Some assumptions I made on LUNR and this landing:

1.) They learned from Odie, their failed moon landing attempt.  Intuitive Machines (IM) did learn, they upgraded cameras and other guidance systems.  They got within 400m of their landing sites on something hundreds of thousands of kilometres away! Impressive!

2.) These are literal rocket scientists and engineers, working with NASA and are probably ex-NASA engineers, should be a safe bet after point 1, right?

Learnings after getting hosed Thursday:

1.) Both 1 and 2 are correct.  Maybe I missed this, but where were their real world trials of this equipment? Why not try to use the same autonomous landing software with orbits around the earth where you have satellites to communicate with or literally watch with? Or use drones to watch with as it nears a landing destination here on Earth?  If there was any activity like this, I would have assumed it would be publicized to help the company stock and profile and also to support the government/private partnership they had, and would have made stock news outlets that I pay attention to; however, maybe I missed it?  The Earth has different gravity and an atmosphere, yes, but you could have tested the software here on Earth and recovered the unit that had dummy weights in it instead of a very expensive drill, a mass spectrometer, and a Nokia cellular network inside of it.

2.) During the landing viewing on Thursday, they mentioned setting up multiple lunar satellites around the moon to help with future missions... Why wouldn't you set those up first?  Seems like better smaller steps to guarantee these much larger, higher risk missions.  Yes, not as sexy as a landing, but probably small (but huge) milestones on the Gantt chart to bigger future missions.  

3.) Assuming #1/#2 to be true, and they had no real world test trials or other information to help aid the landing, did NASA, ultimately send all of their paid assets to the moon on largely unproven systems?  As an investor in the company (a very small investor), did I just do the same thing? 

Not hating on them, I want them to succeed, but it won't be with my money any longer.  I hope their contracts don't get cut by Elon/DOGE/etc that think this is a 'wasteful' program after now having two failed missions.  Afterall, other competitors landed successfully earlier in the week.  

In the current political climate, LUNR seems like a very risky bet at this point, and not an investment, unless there's some laying out of steps to guarantee future success.  Given that the federal government is largely their only source of revenue at this point, it's a massive question mark.  I'll probably invest in BUD instead at this point, they're on a tear since earning.  Even SMCI might be a better gamble.

1j75j1m,The Reality Behind Tarriffs And Layoffs,"In her most recent discussion, Cathie Wood explains that a rolling recession started with rate hikes in 2022, unemployment has troughed, and economists have only declared recessions retroactively. Yield inversion did indicate a recession, but we've actually gone through most of it and are on the last leg of it now

She talks about how this country used to be mainly funded by tariffs not income tax, with supporting graphs, and that it would make sense to realign with that

She mentions that there will a recession in the government sector for the first time in 30 years since Clinton & Gingrich reduced the size of govt to give us a budget surplus in the 90s. Based on business cycle analysis, anything that goes for 30 years without a correction or a shakeout gets more and more inneffecient over time, and very often there's bad behavior

She believes we are in the last phase of a rolling recession that began in 2022 when the FED started rate hikes. She supports that using unemployment statistics showing layoffs have tripled since the end of Covid, getting to 172k most recently, and in previous recessions we topped out at 240k, Covid being an outlier at 400k

She believes it's basically as bad it can get already, saying that business and consumer sentiment has fallen through the fears over the transition into this Administration and some feeling of chaos.... But federal govt workers make up less than 2% of the nation's work force while sttate+local govt workers combined make up over 20% of employment in the US

She thinks the measures this administration are taking will reduce govt deficit from the current -7.21% to their goal of -2.5%, ""tax cuts and deregulation will turbocharge nombimal gdp growth. The best way to get out of a deficit is to grow at an accelerate with increasing productivity (like '90-2000 which gave us the last surplus)."" She expects another surplus to be coming, if not during this administration then because of it

She states that inflation has peaked, drawing a parallel that ""expected inflation rates 5-10 years ahead are, interestingly again, at the same level when Clinton and Gingrich were wrestling the government sector to the ground."" Oil prices are already going down, with Trump wanting three more million barrels produced in america, and OPEC committing to more production. So gas prices will keep going down bringing inflation down further. Mortgage rates have been dropping YTD and can't go up because housing prices aren't going down

She expects a large rebound in small businesses in the next few years from tax cuts and deregulation, and a productivity boom that takes us into ""new orbit of global real GDP growth."" 7.3% compared to 3% that we've been at for the last 125 years because AI is propelling every other tech

""Strongest bull market in history if we're right""

&nbsp;

I think Cathie Wood has underperformed in typical markets but is very good at timing bottoms (she was spot on during Corona and was way ahead of all of Wall St. in confidently predicting a rapid V shaped recovery). Her funds are specifically geared towards capturing maximum *future* growth, as opposed to maximum returns in the current year. In general, to me it seems she habitually puts out ""best case"" scenarios that haven't always been fully met, and it causes her funds to lag the indexes, but in the broad sense her arguments are usually right (even if some price targets are off)

This was Cathie Wood on March 30, 2020. 7 days after the market bottomed

>""The measures taken by the government will contribute to, what I don't think many people believe will happen, but we do believe - that a V shaped recovery has a much better opportunity of happening now because of these incentives to get back to work and the financial stimulus. . . We were talking about a V shaped recovery before this crisis even happened. Consumer consumption was going up, inventories were going down, and capital expenditure was falling. So we thought there was a rubber band stretching here, and it would at some point turn in a very strong way and we would have a V shaped recovery as businesses tried to catch up to consumers. . . If the policy measures the government put in place clear within a few weeks to a month, then I think we are looking at a V shaped recovery. . . We sequenced this virus in 2 days as opposed to the 5 months it took to sequence SARS, and we are now developing vaccines and anti-viral medications at breakneck speed.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j75j1m/the_reality_behind_tarriffs_and_layoffs/,1741519006.0

Concerns include slowing sales, especially in key markets like Germany, where registrations fell by 76%, and the U.S., with a nearly 6% drop in February.

The heavyweights have been in a downtrend for a couple of months before the latest headlines.  Or are emotional reactions, like fear and panic selling, influencing the market more than we think?

>Glen Scheinberg runs the larger of the two index-rebalancing teams, a group known as SRBL, while Dubai-based Pratik Madhvani manages the other crew focused on the strategy, the people said. A representative for Millennium declined to comment.

>Index rebalancing — often highly leveraged — involves betting on which companies enter or exit various stock indexes, and it can be lucrative for giant multimanager hedge funds like Millennium.

>Yet bouts of market unrest combined with the crowded nature of the trades can also trigger significant losses — even if portfolio managers bet on the right stocks.

>Hong Kong-based senior portfolio manager Jeremy Ma, who also specialized in index-rebalancing trades, has left Millennium, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Ma didn’t reply to a social-media message seeking comment.

>Index rebalancing has soured returns before, including in 2022.

>One fund manager estimated that just a dozen firms deployed the trade in 1998. That number ballooned to at least 50 firms in more recent years — including various pods at the big multimanagers — before deteriorating returns drove some traders away.

>The upside can be significant, though. Scheinberg and Madhvani’s groups were both profitable last year.

There is nearly unlimited pricing power with AWS because of the lock in these companies agree to. It’s very hard to switch to, say, Azure.

AWS is the profit center of AMZN, and it’s one of the fastest growing segments of the business in the recent years. High margins here. High demand- leading to high cap-ex leading to a selloff since earnings about a month ago. Well, and the tariffs.

My average cost basis is 187 currently. I own almost 14k of Amazon. But if it trades below to 180-185 region, with already being at historically low PE ratio, and dipping on short term uncertainty despite long term moat, I’m going to sell 7k of my 32k of VTI.

Orcl: 15%
Potential contender to buy tik tok, data giant and huge demand for data centers with AI, cash flow machine

Cava: 15%

NBIS: 2.5%
Risky data center play. Huge cash pile and massive demand. Solid team with proven execution. 

Amzn (@$188): 15%
Undervalued right now, use it all the time. AWS will thrive with AI. Amazing company will be around for years. 

AMD: 2.5%
They’re lagging NVDA, overall risky but they will still grow from AI and could one day develop something to dethrone NVDA. Hopefully they don’t end up like INTC

TSMC: 2.5%

1j60tsx,"If you are thinking of selling or not buying at this time, read this piece from Morgan Housel’s book: “Psychology of Money”.","I know how scary it feels to see the market crash and still not panic and sell your assets, but read this analysis from Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel:

“Consider what would happen if you saved $1 every month from 1900 to 2019.

You could invest that $1 into the U.S. stock market every month, rain or shine. It doesn’t matter if economists are screaming about a looming recession or new bear market. You just keep investing. Let’s call an investor who does this Sue.

But maybe investing during a recession is too scary. So perhaps you invest your $1 in the stock market when the economy is not in a recession, sell everything when it’s in a recession and save your monthly dollar in cash, and invest everything back into the stock market when the recession ends. We’ll call this investor Jim.

Or perhaps it takes a few months for a recession to scare you out, and then it takes a while to regain confidence before you get back in the market. You invest $1 in stocks when there’s no recession, sell six months after a recession begins, and invest back in six months after a recession ends. We’ll call you Tom.

How much money would these three investors end up with over time?

Sue ends up with $435,551.
Jim has $257,386.
Tom $234,476.

Sue wins by a mile.

There were 1,428 months between 1900 and 2019. Just over 300 of them were during a recession. So by keeping her cool during just the 22% of the time the economy was in or near a recession, Sue ends up with almost three-quarters more money than Jim or Tom.”

So in essence, hold your course and keep buying a small amount of every month no matter what happens. If you don’t keep buying, you will miss the chance to buy low because you will never know when the low is until it’s too late and the market had already recovered, and if you panic and sell everything you will not get back to the market until it has already recovered and you would end up buying after the stocks are much higher than what you sold at.

> NEW YORK — Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday that the central bank can wait to see how President Donald Trump’s aggressive policy actions play out before it moves again on interest rates.
> 
> With markets nervous over Trump’s proposals for tariffs and other issues, Powell reiterated statements he and his colleagues have made recently counseling patience on monetary policy amid the high level of uncertainty.
> 
> The White House “is in the process of implementing significant policy changes in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation,” he said in a speech for the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum. “It is the net effect of these policy changes that will matter for the economy and for the path of monetary policy.”
> 
> Noting that “uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high” Powell said the Fed is “focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.”
> 
> The comments seem at least somewhat at odds with growing market expectations for interest rate cuts this year.
> 
> As markets have been roiled by Trump’s shifting positions on his agenda — specifically his tariff plans — traders have priced in the equivalent of three quarter percentage point reductions by the end of the year, starting in June, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch gauge.
> 
> However, Powell’s comments indicate that the Fed will be in a wait-and-see mode before mapping out further policy easing.
> 
> “Policy is not on a preset course,” he said. “Our current policy stance is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.”
> 
> The policy forum is sponsored by the University of Chicago’s Booth School’s Clark Center for Global Markets and included multiple Fed officials in the audience. Most central bank policymakers lately have said they expect the economy to hold up and inflation to fall back to the Fed’s 2% goal, with the rate climate still unclear as Trump’s policy comes more clearly into view.
> 
> In his assessment, Powell also spoke in mostly positive terms about the macro environment, saying the U.S. is in “a good place” with a “solid labor market” and inflation moving back to target.
> 
> However, he did note that recent sentiment surveys showed misgivings about the path of inflation, largely a product of the Trump tariff talk. The Fed’s preferred gauge showed 12-month inflation running at a 2.5% rate, or 2.6% when excluding food and energy.
> 
> “The path to sustainably returning inflation to our target has been bumpy, and we expect that to continue,” Powell said.
> 
> Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, who was not at the forum, said in a speech delivered Friday in Portugal that she sees “important upside risks for inflation” and said that “it could be appropriate to continue holding the policy rate at its current level for some time.”
> 
> The remarks also came the same day that the Labor Department reported a gain of 151,000 in nonfarm payrolls for February. Though the total was slightly below market expectations, Powell said the report is more evidence that “the labor market is solid and broadly in balance.”
> 
> “Wages are growing faster than inflation, and at a more sustainable pace than earlier in the pandemic recovery,” he said.
> 
> Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in February and were up 4% on an annual basis. The jobs report also indicated that the unemployment rate edged higher to 4.1% as household employment dipped.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j5woab/powell_says_fed_is_awaiting_greater_clarity_on/,1741373524.0

News: [Us Employment Report For February](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-03-07/us-employment-report-for-february)

**Ticker:** [**AVGO (Broadcom)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AVGO&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Earnings. Reported EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.49 exp, revenue of $14.92B vs. $14.61B expected. AVGO gave strong guidance of $14.9B vs $14.76B. Cited strong growth due to AI chips and/infrastructure components for training AI.

**Technicals:** Watching to see if we break $200 level today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** I think we're seeing the AI hype become more concentrated in the ""winners"" of the AI race now. There are some companies that ARE citing falling demand for their AI related products while others are stating that demand is still robust. Likely going to see greater consolidation in the future. Major chipmakers like Broadcom are benefiting from hyperscaler investments in AI over the 3 year AI boom.

**Risks:** Tariffs/supply chain constraints make the supply chain far more tenuous.

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, QCOM, all other semiconductor stocks

**Ticker:** [**LUNR (Intuitive Machines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUNR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** LUNR’s uncrewed Nova-C lander, Athena, encountered challenges upon landing on the Moon. (Something to do with their lunar lander not landing at the correct angle, I'm no rocket scientist.)

**Technicals:** LUNR sold off close to 40% yesterday, watching to see if we break the lows at $6.70 premarket. We had 3 major spikes (2 went to the lower) and I'm interested in seeing if we can make any form of recovery today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** These exploratory spaceflight companies are insanely volatile and depend on their spaceflights doing well- as seen yesterday.

**Risks:** Technical malfunctions could impact investor confidence and future funding. Delays in future missions or failures in securing government contracts could also hinder growth.

**Related Tickers:** ASTS, RKLB

**Ticker:** [**WBA (Walgreens)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WBA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** WBA has agreed to a \~$10B deal with Sycamore Partners to take the company private. Deal is $11.45/shr in cash.

**Technicals:** We saw a strong spike from 10.60 -> 11.20 after the news.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Buyout play, but obviously there's not much reward left on this catalyst.

**Risks:** Deal could get cancelled, more delays, regulatory scrutiny, etc.

**Ticker:** [**HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HPE&p=d)

**Catalyst:** EPS of $0.49 vs. $0.49 expected. Revenue of $7.85B vs. $7.82B expected. HPE’s results were in line with expectations but they cited profit next year would be hurt by tariffs and had weak margins on server sales. Stated IT products from China and Mexico would affect the company’s outlook.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The IT hardware sector is facing supply chain disruptions and rising production costs due to tariff outlook. Easy rule of thumb: the more complex the product (advanced electronics), the more affected by tariffs they are.

I know that ABC in investing is to not to time the market but with all the indicators that s&p 500 is going to fall I was getting too anxious and thought I'd get the bit that I made over the last 2 years. If it rises again I don't think it'll be a sharp jump as the sharp drop we're having now. Or was this the wrong strategy? 

What do people think about Berkshire Hathaway being the default fund to put my savings in? It seems good to me but perhaps there are even better options. I'm mid 30s so I can take some risk but still want to be diversified to an extent. I have an emergency fund outside of the stocks already.

1j5lbmx,The recent market decline offers opportunities.,"
*Selling may offer some feeling of relief. But it also locks in losses and prevents the chance of making the money back over time. 

*Historically, the S&P 500 has come back from every one of its downturns to eventually make investors whole again. 

*That includes after the Great Depression, the dot-com bust and the 2020 COVID crash.

1j5knva,What should I learn from this,"During COVID I bought Air France-KLM stocks. It was at a very low point and I thought it would bounce back after the crisis. It didn't, it only got worse but I kept the stocks for quite a few years.

It kind of leveled on a 60% loss since I bought it and just didnt seem to have a lot of perspective based on the news and expert analyses. About 2-3 weeks ago I decided to take my losses and cut it so I sold. I invested in a defence related ETF (which is doing fine enough).

Today I decided to check Air France-KLM again and apparently they published a descent turnover a few days ago and the stock increased 30% in value overnight and is still hoovering around that number.

Ofcourse this would not have leveled my original investment and it might just as easily fall back but still....it feels depressing that after years of waiting I sold out 2 weeks too soon.

What should I learn from this and how can I prevent this from happening again? [And yes Im an amateur]

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1j5jkyp,NAS100 Index: Fundamentals & Technicals Overview,"Focus is now on Trump's White House crypto summit, kicking off later today (Friday). Recently, Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve using seized assets, though he made it clear that the government won’t be buying Bitcoin directly, a move that hasn't sat well with many in the crypto community.

Investors are also on edge waiting for the U.S. jobs report and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech, which could give us clues about the economy’s direction and future monetary policy. Meanwhile, the Money Fear and Greed Index is still stuck in the ""Extreme Fear"" zone, highlighting the overall market anxiety.

I’m predicting a weak February Non-Farm Payrolls report, and there’s a good chance the March job numbers could miss expectations too. The job market is under intense scrutiny, and some analysts are already warning of negative news that might dampen any positive shifts from the Fed.

Given all this uncertainty, I’d advise caution with intraday trading today.

I have the ability to invest £500 a month moving forwards. For now, I have selected ACC not DIST, as the dividends I will receive are pennies.

My concept is, that by retirement age, I would like to be able to have a degree of income from the dividends, which hopefully won't be so negligible at that time.

I know that for long term building, ACC generally works better as it auto reinvests the dividends. When I do reach a time in life, decades from now, where I want to realise some of the potential gain and start receiving dividends, how would that work?

Do I need to sell, face the CGT then just rebuy the fund under DIST? Would this not likely be a large tax hit?

What would you say is worth looking at ? Long term goal is to stack £500 into it for approx 40 years, then once I'm retired, use the dividends towards living comfortably.

* **Earnings per share:** $4.02 vs. $4.11 expected
* **Revenue:** $63.72 billion vs. $63.13 billion expected

1j52rik,Tariffs & Investor Behavior – Quick Reference,"# 📉 Market Performance During Tariff Episodes

* **2018–19 Trump Tariffs:**
   * 2018: S&P down \~4.4%, volatility spike, major drawdowns on tariff announcements.
   * 2019: S&P up \~31.5% after easing tensions (Fed pivot & Phase I deal).
* **2002 Bush Steel Tariffs:**
   * \~$2 trillion market cap wiped from S&P 500 (Mar 2002–May 2003).
   * Dow didn't recover fully until tariffs lifted (late 2003).

Takeaway: **Tariffs create volatility & sell-offs, markets rally when resolved.**

# 💰 Large-Cap Index Funds & ETF Flows

* **Passive Investing Dominance:**
   * Continued net inflows to large-cap index ETFs (VOO/SPY) despite volatility.
   * 2018: Passive +$207B inflows, Active –$174B outflows.
   * Record active-fund outflows in acute stress (Dec 2018: $143B).
* **Reactionary Outflows/Inflows:**
   * Brief ETF outflows during tariff scares (SPY lost \~$12.4B May 2019).
   * Quick rebounds once panic subsided.
* **U.S. Stocks vs. Global Peers:**
   * U.S. large-caps generally more resilient than foreign/emerging markets (e.g. China –30% in 2018).

Takeaway: **Passive investing remained sticky; short-term investor panics quickly reversed.**

# 🔄 Sector Rotations

Investors rotated from:

|❌ Outflows / Losers|✅ Inflows / Winners|
|:-|:-|
|Global Industrials, Materials (XLI)|Domestic-focused (Small caps, Russell 2000)|
|High international exposure firms|Defensive sectors (Utilities, Staples, Insurance)|
|Broad equity during peaks of fear|Bonds (Treasuries, short-duration), Money market funds|
|Emerging markets & foreign stocks|Gold, safe-haven currencies (JPY, CHF)|

* **Tariff ""Winners"":** Brief rallies in steel/aluminum producers, agriculture; gains often short-lived due to retaliations & input costs.

Takeaway: **Money flowed toward domestic safety & traditional defensive sectors during trade turmoil.**

# 🏢 Institutional vs. Retail Investor Behavior

|Institutional Investors|Retail Investors|
|:-|:-|
|Actively managed risk, tactical reallocations (ETFs, Treasuries, low-volatility stocks).|Mostly stuck to passive allocation (VOO).|
|Increased ETF use (18.5% to 24.8% asset allocation).|Short-lived panic spikes (record outflows Dec 2018: \~$46B).|
|Quick to hedge & reposition during volatility spikes; cautiously ""bought dips"".|U.S. home bias: kept investing domestically, withdrew from international/EM funds.|

Takeaway: **Institutions tactically managed risk, retail mostly stayed course due to structural (401k, passive) investing.**

# 📊 Macro Context Matters

* **2002 vs 2018–19 contrasts:**
   * 2002 steel tariffs exacerbated existing bear market & recession fears.
   * 2018 Fed tightening + tariff escalation = severe outflows, volatility.
   * 2019 Fed easing offset tariff concerns, investors returned confidently.
* **Global economy influence:**
   * Tariff uncertainty = downgraded global growth forecasts, hurt export-driven EM countries (capital flight).
   * Sector-specific fundamental impacts (""tariffs"" = earnings call red flags).
* **Resolution relief:**
   * Tariff de-escalation consistently triggered market rallies and investor return (2003, late-2019 Phase I deal).

Takeaway: **Tariff impacts amplified or moderated by macroeconomic & monetary policy backdrop.**

# 📌 Core Insights & Patterns

1. **Short-lived Panic & Risk-Off Rotation:** Markets reliably dropped immediately after tariff announcements, investors shifted swiftly to bonds/cash/gold/defensive stocks.
2. **Rotation, Not Retreat:** Investors didn't abandon equities fully—rotated to safer bets. Favored domestic, defensive plays.
3. **Institutional Discipline & ETF Tactical Use:** Institutions proactively hedged, adjusted portfolios via liquid ETFs, buying dips strategically once volatility subsided.
4. **Macro Backdrop Shapes Impact:** Fed policy & economic growth outlook critically influence magnitude of tariff-driven flows & volatility.
5. **Historical Rhymes & Opportunities:** Tariff-driven sell-offs consistently followed by eventual relief rallies.

📉 **S&P 500 E-minis:** \-55 points (-0.94%)

📉 **Nasdaq 100 E-minis:** \-233.25 points (-1.13%)

• **Tariffs making things worse** – Trump hit **Canada & Mexico with 25% tariffs** and **China with a 20% hike**. Markets arent happy, and the risk of retaliation is growing.

• **Big economic data incoming** – Jobless claims today, but the big one is **Friday’s payrolls report**. That could shake up rate cut expectations for June.

1j4wtlp,Rookie investor: should I think about long term international stocks given the volatility of US markets?,"Basically title: my experience with stocks has been passively contributing to an S&P 500 and toying with some small and big companies for experimenting and learning. I'm not well off, and I'm acutely aware stocks are not a get rich scheme, but I'm concerned that the amount of money I've manage to grow in the 5 or so years I've been in the space could be really wounded by the current administration's choices and plans. 

The impetus for this post came from the US discourse of a NATO withdrawal, among the many tariffs placed globally. My question is with this in mind, should international stocks become a part of my focus? I don't have any confidence that US supremacy will hold over the next 4 years and possibly long after. Europe will need to boost spending to supplement US contributions to NATO and I'm wondering if the relationships between countries will push other industries away from the US.

1j4wi5v,Are these stocks about to collapse due to Trump's executive order?,"Donald Trump will sign an executive order today to close the Department of Education to save money. I did a little more research into what effect this could have on stocks and came across the following post.

What do you think about this and the effects on these stocks?

BREAKING: President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order as soon as Thursday to abolish the Department of Education!

----

""I spent 3 hours researching intensively last night and came up with the following 5 stocks that are heavily dependent on the US Department of Education and could come under considerable pressure today.

Disclaimer: I have now gone short on a few of them.

 ------

""If Donald Trump were to disband the Department of Education (DoE) and transfer its functions to the states, the following companies would face significant negative impacts. 

Here's why for each company:

1. Nelnet Inc.

Nelnet is one of the largest student loan servicers in the U.S. and administers federal student loans.

Eliminating the DoE would mean significantly restructuring or eliminating the Federal Student Aid (FSA) program.

If the states create their own programs, Nelnet could lose customers and revenue because there would no longer be a centralized lending agency.

2. Lincoln Educational Services

This company operates private career and technical schools that rely heavily on federal funding, particularly Pell Grants and federal loans.

Without the DoE, it could become more difficult for students to access financial aid, leading to declining enrollment.

 3. Adtalem Global Education

Parenting company of several private colleges, including medical schools, that benefit greatly from federal student loans and accreditation through the DoE.

Without the DoE, accreditation processes could shift to the states, creating an inconsistent system and uncertainty.

The reduced availability of federal funding could lead to a decline in student enrollment and revenue.

4. Navient Corporation

Similar to Nelnet, Navient is a loan servicer that manages large volumes of federal student loans.

If the DoE is dissolved, existing loan agreements could be restructured or eliminated, which would massively impact business operations.

5. Grand Canyon Education

Operates Grand Canyon University, a large private college that relies on federal student aid programs.

The elimination of the DoE could mean that students from different states would have different access to loans and aid, which could threaten the university's enrollment and revenue.

 Summary

All of these companies are heavily dependent on federal student loans, grant programs, and accreditation policies that the DoE administers.

Transferring these responsibilities to the states could lead to uncertainty, a decrease in funding sources, and an uncoordinated system, which would significantly threaten their business models.

1j4sku9,Thinking about selling LMT (and maybe even RTX),"Hello everyone,

I have with LMT and RTX two US defense contractors in my portfolio. With the latest news from the Ukraine war I am concerned that their revenue will be hurt badly because the US president decided to limit the range of HIMARS.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2025/03/05/abruptly-blocking-intel-the-us-prevents-ukraines-himars-from-firing-for-maximum-effect/

I am sure that a lot of countries will take this into consideration that if you are ordering modern US weapons you are at mercy of the US president.
Maybe some countries will reevaluate their existing orders as well. E.g. Poland ordered 486 HIMARS. 

On the other side the existing F35 orders should be pretty safe because there isn’t an European stealth fighter jet available right now. But selling more of these, at least to European countries, should be hard.

The US plan to decrease the defense budget also isn’t helping both stocks.

But at the end, RTX should have enough civilian exposure in my opinion.

Consumer spending looks to be contracting. People are increasingly price conscious and Target is neither a high end retailer whose customers will shrug off cost increases nor a true value shop that will minimize costs. Target ceo said that they would raise prices in response to tariffs. 



It looks like a perfect storm is hitting Target. A weak consumer. A disturbance of the middle tier retail niche. Inflation and tariffs raising prices and compressing margins. And very poor sentiment among their consumers.

News: [Trump Hails Tariffs as US Economy Barrels Into Trade Wars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-to-tout-tariffs-unveil-energy-mineral-projects-in-speech)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)**,** [**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)**,** [**SMH (Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)**,** [**SOXL (3x Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SOXL&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump has called for an end to the CHIPS Act Subsidy Program (instead preferring tariffs).

**Technicals:** Short biased. Obviously this takes away a lot of investment in semis companies. Extremely negative catalyst but unlikely it will get repealed due to how much bipartisan support it had.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The CHIPS and Science Act gave $280B in new funding to boost domestic research/manufacturing of semis in the US, and also aimed to strengthen supply chain resilience against China and widely considered to be a success because it spurred the development/dominance in the semis sector in America.

**Risks:** If this gets repealed, we're likely going to see a pretty large pullback in the semis. Obviously this is dependent on what the tariffs Trump touts will do as well. [I wrote a little more about my take on a different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j437g9/trump_calls_for_end_to_52_billion_chips_act/) but overall more of the same (I think it's a terrible idea).

**Ticker:** [**GM (General Motors)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&p=d)**,** [**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)**,** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is considering granting relief from the recently imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

**Technicals:** We've seen all three stocks (GM especially) make gains due to this announcement, will watch at open for volume.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The automotive industry in US/Canada/Mexico involves the most economic/manufacturing cooperation in the USMCA, they're the most obvious beneficiaries of this potential catalyst.

**Risks:** If they don't actually give relief, then will likely pullback- cars are one of the most affected products of tariffs and pretty much every car company has spoken about tariffs on their earnings calls.

**Ticker:** [**IBIT (IBIT)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBIT&p=d)**,** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**,** [**HOOD (Robinhood Markets)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that Trump plans to grant the main biggest CC a ""unique status"" within the Bitcoin reserve strategy, which will be unveiled at the White House Crypto Summit on Friday.

**Technicals:** We've seen the underlying spike close to 8-9% since yesterday, watching $90K level. Interested to see how we go prior to the actual summit.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Obviously an extremely bullish catalyst, we've bounced strongly off the $80K level recently. I usually trade through the ETFs as needed, and HOOD/Coinbase serve as proxies in case the ETFs aren't liquid or have already moved.

**Risks:** Worth waiting for the catalyst and watching the CC Summit on Friday. I personally see this more of a ""buy on hype"" kind of catalyst, unless there's an announcement of something extremely bullish I'm not sure how much more this will move the needle.

**Ticker:** [**HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HII&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump has announced initiatives aimed at strengthening the U.S. shipbuilding industry to counter China's dominance, spoke about the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding and the introduction of special tax incentives.

**Technicals:** None that I'm particularly interested in, this is a longer-term play.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China produces over half of the world's merchant vessels, this is more of a play to reduce reliance on foreign-shipping.

**Risks:** There's a chance that this will never happen, Trump tried to create a ""Cybersecurity Department"" in his first term but that was never formally created and we kept those duties spread out between the FBI/DHS/NSA. But we also have the Space Force so... stay tuned.

>The Chips Act is among the most significant US forays into industrial policy in more than a generation. It set aside $39 billion in grants — plus loans and 25% tax breaks — to revitalize American semiconductor manufacturing, as well as $11 billion for chip research and development. The aim was to reduce reliance on Asia for electronic components that power everything from smartphones to massive data centers.

>Trump, however, has consistently derided a program he regards as a waste of government funds, arguing tariffs would achieve the same outcome while filling coffers. Republicans have also indicated that they want to repeal what they see as “social” provisions of the Chips Act. That could involve eliminating labor-friendly regulations or environmental requirements.

>Officials on both sides of the aisle have touted the Chips Act as crucial to US national and economic security, and Trump could have a hard time getting congressional support to repeal it. Dozens of GOP lawmakers voted for the measure, and many red districts have won factories or other projects supported by the law.

>That includes South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc., which have committed to multibillion-dollar projects in Texas and Indiana that were contingent on funding and support from the US government. Company representatives declined to comment on the president’s remarks.

>Trump, favoring tariffs over incentives, has signaled that import levies on chips could come as soon as next month. Companies can avoid those duties, he has said, by building factories on American soil. He has not offered additional details.

>On Monday, Trump credited the tariff threats for TSMC’s decision to invest $100 billion in the US, on top of a previous $65 billion commitment. He touted that project in his address Tuesday, referencing the full $165 billion figure. “We’re giving them no money,” Trump said. “All that was important to them was they didn’t want to pay the tariffs.”

>A TSMC spokesperson declined to comment.

>The company originally announced plans for a $12 billion US site during Trump’s first term and expanded that project to three factories under Biden. To support those facilities, TSMC struck an agreement with Biden officials for $6.6 billion in Chips Act grants and $5 billion in loans.

>As is the case for other Chips Act awards, the funding is supposed to be disbursed over time, as TSMC hits negotiated project milestones. The company received $1.5 billion before Biden left office.

>Trump did not specify whether he would attempt to claw back money that’s already been disbursed, renege on remaining incentives to which the government has already committed, or simply not provide additional support for the chipmaker’s latest investment. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Monday that the newly announced projects — three additional chip plants, plus R&D and advanced packaging sites — won’t win federal funds.

>“The main uncertainty is the future of TSMC,” said Xin-Yao Ng, an investment director at abrdn plc. “One long-time competitive advantage was their clustering in Taiwan, where labor costs are still reasonable, construction costs are cheaper, government is supportive, and they can find more workers with vocational training. It’s completely different in the US if they are to shift more manufacturing. Subsidies from US were to be crucial to help mitigate some of the higher costs and challenges.”

>TSMC is among 20 companies that reached binding Chips Act agreements with Biden officials. The deals, which represent more than 85% of the manufacturing incentives available under the program, are designed to support leading-edge facilities by companies like TSMC, Intel, Samsung and Micron Technology Inc. — as well as older-generation factories by the likes of GlobalFoundries Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc.

>Companies have generally viewed those agreements as ironclad — regardless of who’s in office. But some of them have worried that the Trump administration could seek to modify the terms, Bloomberg has reported. Lutnick has said he cannot commit to honoring existing contracts without reviewing them first.

>That review is ongoing, and Lutnick’s intentions for the initiative remain unclear. So far, his questions to program staff have focused on the rationale behind award decisions and the government’s legal authority to claw money back, Bloomberg has reported. The current Chips Act team, meanwhile, has been preparing a list of potential adjustments to the funding application process and final contracts that would be minimally disruptive.

>A spokesperson for GlobalWafers Co., which won $406 million from the Chips Act for factories in Texas and Missouri, said the Taiwanese company is committed to its expansion strategy and views any changes to the Chips Act as “unlikely.”

>But if the law were to be modified in some way, the spokesperson said, “we would reassess future investments, including evaluating US market demand, pricing, and potential tariffs if production were moved outside the US.”

**My take:** Brutally bad for semiconductor sector if CHIPS is actually repealed, INTC is especially targeted. There'd be less semiconductor manufacturing in the US (INTC/TSM/Samsung) primarily because we subsidize and have tax incentives for current US chip manfacturing projects, and companies that haven't received their funding will likely scale back projects [(remember INTC delayed their Ohio plant to 2028?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j0cq51/intel_delays_28_billion_ohio_chip_factory_in_new/). The US would also be far more dependent on semiconductor production overseas. 

This also has spillover into the quantum computing stocks (IONQ/RGTI) and AI sector due to the sectors being so reliant on technological development and supply from the semis sectors.

Overall don't think new tariffs are going to be an adequate replacement for what the US has committed so far (but we don't know much about  the tariffs yet), and the markets hate uncertainty.

Example: since delta cannot equal 1 or 0 as long as time>0, getting contracts initially where both deltas are around 1 means that as long as one side remains net positive, that delta will be 1 and the other will be less than one (until the date of expiry) meaning you will pick up profit with even the slightest move on other side.

1j41oqg,Goldman Wins Rare Solo Role on Blockbuster $19 Billion Port Deal,"
Goldman is currently the only investment bank working on the sale of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. ports to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.

The transaction — with proceeds of $19 billion — includes two ports on either side of the Panama Canal, which Donald Trump has long wanted in US hands.

Data compiled by Bloomberg show that Goldman has historically been the top adviser to CK Hutchison, founded by billionaire Li Ka-shing. One of Hong Kong’s most prominent companies, CK Hutchison trades locally under the ticker 1.HK.

Once the BlackRock consortium showed interest in the port assets, which include the two in Panama and more than 40 others worldwide, there was a rush to sign an memorandum of understanding and file it to the Hong Kong stock exchange ahead of Trump’s address to Congress in Washington, D.C., the people said.


In a statement announcing the transaction, Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said the deal resulted from a “rapid, discrete but competitive” process — and was unrelated to politics and reports on the Panama Canal ports.

The role in such a high profile deal is a boost for Goldman, which is already leading the global M&A league table this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j41oqg/goldman_wins_rare_solo_role_on_blockbuster_19/,1741176824.0

The largest U.S. tariff hike since 1930 is now in effect, with China responding with a 15% retaliatory tariff.

The NAS100 is feeling the weight of these developments. At the same time, declining Treasury yields and expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts point to potentially lower interest rates by 2025.

1j3y4nm,Whisper it and it's back: Recession risk creeps onto markets' radar,"[Whisper it and it's back: Recession risk creeps onto markets' radar | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/global-markets-growth-analysis-2025-03-05/)

[RemovePaywall | Free online paywall remover](https://www.removepaywall.com/search?url=https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/global-markets-growth-analysis-2025-03-05/)

LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - Global growth concerns have shot back onto the radar of financial markets as weakening U.S. economic data and growing trade tensions hurt consumer confidence and business activity.

Although recession is not the base-case scenario for economists, given underlying U.S. resilience, recent data has unnerved investors and U.S. President Donald Trump's new 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada are exacerbating growth concerns.

A shift in the mood music is apparent across markets.

Oil prices are at their lowest since October , stocks from New York to Tokyo are retreating from recent multi-year highs and two-year U.S. Treasury yields are at their lowest since October as bond investors see increased chances of near-term rate cuts.

""One thing is essential for an economy and that's confidence, which has taken a hit,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Genvil Wealth Management, referring to weakening U.S. consumer and business sentiment.

""I don't think it's (recession) a done deal but it's a reason why we have decided to decrease (U.S.) equity exposure.""

U.S. consumer confidence in January slumped the most in 3-1/2 years, retail sales dropped by the most in nearly two years, and Monday's U.S. manufacturing activity data showed big falls in new orders and employment.

""We don’t think we will see a (U.S.) recession but we do see a modest growth slowdown,"" said Joost van Leender, senior investment strategist, at Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management in Amsterdam, adding consumers were feeling uncertain about ""chaotic"" U.S. policy.

Van Leender said he had trimmed U.S. equity holdings in late January and is overweight Treasuries as yields are likely to fall as the economy decelerates.

Highlighting the change in fortunes, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model estimate for annualised growth this quarter on Monday fell to -2.8% from +2.3% a week ago.

Analysts stress that recent U.S. data is likely to have been skewed by one-off factors such as cold weather, and strong imports in the case of the Atlanta Fed's model. But they also note that a trade war means focus is quickly shifting from inflation to the growth risks from U.S. tariffs.

China has responded to a doubling of duties on Chinese goods to 20% with additional tariffs of 10%-15% on certain U.S. imports from March 10. Europe is also in the firing line for higher U.S. tariffs, and trade-vulnerable auto stocks dropped 4% on Tuesday after the tariffs on Mexico and Canada, where many cars for the U.S. market are made. (.SXAP), opens new tab

Morgan Stanley estimates that the new U.S. tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada could shave 0.7-1.1 percentage points off U.S. economic growth in coming quarters, deliver a 2.2 to 2.8 percentage point hit to Canadian growth, and push Mexico into recession.

Canadian Chamber of Commerce CEO Candace Laing warned that U.S. tariff policy was forcing Canada and the U.S. toward ""recessions, job losses and economic disaster"".

""Time to add a new word to the dictionary, 'Trumpcession', SEB economist Marcus Widén said in a note.

RATE CUT PRESSURE

The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso briefly hit one-month lows on Tuesday. Notably, the dollar, which has generally benefited from trade tensions, has also weakened as U.S. growth worries weigh .

Some reckon the U.S. economy could be at risk from a worrying mix of sluggish growth and relentless inflation.

Analysts said a trade war keeps pressure on central banks globally to keep cutting rates to shore up growth. Traders are now pricing in 75 basis points of U.S. rate cuts by year-end versus just one cut in mid-January when data was strong.

After ending February with their biggest monthly drop since late 2023, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are eyeing 4% .

""The bond market is moving towards pricing a soft patch and maybe a recession,"" said Forvis Mazars chief economist George Lagarias.

The European Central Bank is tipped to cut rates again on Thursday and Morgan Stanley said it expects another cut in April as economic data and inflation weaken.

Even if U.S. economic data improves, analysts said the cloudier outlook was reason enough to remain cautious on equities.

Hedge funds that had snapped up global equities have fled bullish bets and put on wagers that stocks would decline, a Goldman Sachs note on Monday showed.

Consumer discretionary stocks, an economic bellwether and indicator of shoppers' purchasing power for nice-to-have products, was the worst-performing U.S sector last month, the note showed.

Friday's closely-watched U.S. jobs report takes on additional significance with growth risks in focus.

""This economic cycle is consumption-led and can only die with the labour market,"" said Lombard Odier's chief economist Samy Chaar. ""The Fed has to be very mindful of that.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j3y4nm/whisper_it_and_its_back_recession_risk_creeps/,1741161522.0

1j3q73g,CrowdStrike falls 9% on disappointing earnings forecast,"CrowdStrike shares dropped nearly 9% in extended trading on Tuesday after the cybersecurity software provider issued disappointing earnings guidance.

Here’s what the company reported compared to LSEG estimates:

Earnings per share: $1.03. The number doesn’t to appear to be comparable to analysts’ estimates.

Revenue: $1.06 billion vs. $1.03 billion

Revenue increased 25% from $845.3 million a year earlier, and the company posted a net loss of $92.3 billion, or 37 cents per share. In the year-ago period, the company posted net income of $53.7 million, or 22 cents per share.

For the year, CrowdStrike said it expects earnings, excluding some items, to range between $3.33 and $3.45 per share, falling short of the $4.42 expected by analysts polled by LSEG. First-quarter earnings are expected to be between 64 cents and 66 cents per share, versus the average estimate of 95 cents.

Despite the after-hours drop, CrowdStrike topped some metrics from Wall Street. The company posted $4.24 billion in annual recurring revenue, reflecting 23% growth. That topped the $4.21 billion estimate from analysts surveyed by StreetAccount and included $224 million in net annual recurring revenue.

Revenue guidance was roughly in line with estimates. CrowdStrike said it expects revenue of between $4.74 billion and $4.81 billion for the year, versus an LSEG estimate of $4.77 billion.

The earnings release comes almost eight months after a technology update from the company led to a global IT outage that grounded flights, disrupted businesses and led to class action lawsuits.

CEO George Kurtz said in the press release that artificial intelligence is becoming more important in stopping cyberattacks.

“As businesses of all sizes rapidly adopt AI, stopping the breach necessitates cybersecurity’s AI-native platform,” Kurtz said.

1j3fgx5,Be greedy only when others are fearful,"Over the past 2-3 years, post Covid, I’ve been seeing the market dip here and there and have never felt people were being too fearful. 

But in recent weeks, it’s definitely felt scary. And I think Buffets quote applies even more so now than in recent years (the last time being Covid imo)

Right now, to me, being greedy can mean to buy more - I just don’t have the capital to do so lol

But I also think being greedy can also in some ways interpret a reanalysis of your portfolio, to see if there are any companies that you own that have changed your mind about their prospects, and being strong enough to stay in the market. 

It’s worrying times at the moment, but I think my portfolio is strong enough to weather the storm.

Would I have considered selling and buying back when things are at the bottom? Only if I had Pelosis crystal ball, so I’m staying put",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j3fgx5/be_greedy_only_when_others_are_fearful/,1741107506.0
1j3fe0a,Seeking Advice on IRM: Hold or Sell Amid Price Decline & Borrowed Funds,"I’m currently holding 592.165 shares of IRM entirely in my TFSA, with a book cost of $66,563.52 USD—averaging about $112.41 per share. Most of these shares were bought using an $80,000 CAD line of credit (variable rate at 6.20%) back in November 2024 when IRM was around $120 USD. Now that the stock has fallen to $87.94 USD, I’m in a dilemma.

IRM was still being rated as a solid long-term buy with potential to reach $130 again (which is why I never sold right away), but given the steep drop and the interest accumulating on my credit line, I’m questioning whether I should hang on or sell now to stop the bleeding.

What are your thoughts on:

* The likelihood of a rebound to previous high targets?
* Risk management strategies when 100% of your TFSA is tied to one stock?
* Balancing the cost of borrowing against the potential for recovery?

Any advice or alternative perspectives would be appreciated.

Note: I used ChatGPT to help me with the wording of this question in case anyone cares. My first attempt was just terrible so I figured a better worded question would get better responses.

> The world economy could face a crash similar to the Great Depression of the 1930s unless the U.S. rows back on its plans to impose steep tariffs on imports, a senior official at the International Chamber of Commerce warned.
> 
> “Our deep concern is that this could be the start of a downward spiral that puts us in 1930s trade-war territory,” said Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary-general of the ICC, which promotes global business and trade. High tariffs on foreign goods imported into the U.S. in that decade contributed to a damaging global recession. The downturn plunged nearly a third of the global workforce into unemployment and slashed production at heavyweight industrial economies Germany and the U.S. by half, according to research from the International Monetary Fund.
> 
> The likelihood of a similarly severe blow to the global economy is high, Wilson said in an interview Tuesday. “Right now it’s a coin-flip,” he said. “It comes down to whether the U.S. administration is willing to rethink the utility of tariffs.”
> 
> His comments come after tariffs of 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico came into effect in the U.S., stymieing hopes of an eleventh-hour reprieve. Fresh duties were also added to Chinese goods sold to the country. Trump has promised to impose similar tariffs on European goods, raising the prospect of retaliation in kind and a global trade war.
> 
> “That puts us in a remarkably precarious position that will cloud the global economy for the coming months,” Wilson said.
> President Trump was voted into office in November after a campaign centred on pledges to protect U.S. manufacturers by raising the barrier for imports into the country from abroad. Trump has repeatedly pointed to the U.S. deficit in its good trade with many partners, including China and the EU, calling those gaps unfair. But economists warn that a steep rise in import costs could cause a renewed spike in price inflation in the U.S.
> 
> “There is a real risk to [American] domestic economy of taking a tariff-led approach,” Wilson said.

1j3dnno,"While Markets Nosedive Lower, Phone Stocks and Hedging Stocks are Ripping","As I type the markets are tanking. However, that's on the surface. You have to look deeper to see what stocks and sectors are bucking the trend. Something has just surprised me: telecom and trading-related stocks are outperforming at a BIG level. Check this out:

**AT&T ($T) is up 20% YTD**  
**Verizon ($VZ) has climbed about 10% YTD**  
**CME Group ($CME) is up about 11% YTD**  
**CBOE ($CBOE) is up about 10% YTD**

Let's break this down a bit further:

Telecom and phone stocks are considered to be a bit more resilient in downturns because they serve an essential function: it's how you communicate with friends, family, customers, businesses, and essentially stay in touch with the things that matter most. So, while markets are tanking, some of these telecom and phone stocks are simply ripping. Here's the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/ainzi8xi0pme1.png?width=3020&format=png&auto=webp&s=933fde0b5063825870236f466d566a76dc60ac3c

But it’s not just telecom. **Volatility and trading-related companies are also benefiting from current market conditions.** As uncertainty rises, trading volumes spike, and firms facilitating derivatives trading are seeing direct gains. Futures trading, which CME Group is the leader in, and options trading, CBOE, can thrive in uncertain environments, and the rising interest in hedging strategies can fuel their momentum. Check this out:

https://preview.redd.it/1d8vp4ap0pme1.png?width=3020&format=png&auto=webp&s=51803e961d0306e355b2f1243d685313fa3fc534

I find all of this rather fascinating because while markets tank, there is still some outperformance going on out there. Also, it leads me to wonder what telecom/phone/ VOIP/communication providers might also be worth a play? In terms of trading action, are there other names out there like CBOE or CME? Stocks that specialize in volatility?

TD Cowen analysts in a note Friday said the tech giant had scrapped leases for sizeable data center capacity in the United States, suggesting potential oversupply as it builds out artificial intelligence infrastructure.The brokerage, citing its supply chain checks, said Microsoft has canceled leases totaling ""a couple of hundred megawatts"" of capacity with at least two private data-center operators, the analysts led by Michael Elias said.Microsoft's plan to invest over $80 billion in AI and cloud capacity this fiscal year remains on track, a company spokesperson said. ""While we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions,"" the spokesperson added.While Microsoft shares were little affected - the stock lost 1% on Monday - related companies took a hit.

News: [Trump Tariffs China, Canada, Mexico](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-03-04/trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico)

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reports preliminary February China deliveries of 30,688 cars, down close to 50% from last year.

**Technicals:** Overall a brutal delivery report. TSLA has been on a slide since post-election highs and frankly shows no real sign of recovery. Looking for a small bounce in this stock but I don't think there is much potential for long-term recovery.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** TSLA's EV sales have been declining in China mainly due to BYD, which are considered to make better cars for far cheaper outside the US. The US has a 100% EV tariff for non-US made EV vehicles.

**Risks:** BYD has been eating TSLA's lunch outside of the US. I truly don't see TSLA retaining dominance as the EV of choice outside the US. 

**Ticker:** [**OKTA (Okta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKTA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Okta beat earnings expectations with EPS of $.78 vs $.74,gave guidance that supports EPS of $3.20 vs $2.93. (Also note that CRWD reports today but are not direct competitors)

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Cybersecurity (more specifically IAM) grows yearly mainly due to RPO and cRPO (remaining performance obligations). This is subscription backlog expected to be recognized over the next 12 months.

**Risks:** Market saturation/pricing concerns from competitors.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Nvidia is front and center as the stock most affected by tariff concerns.

**Technicals:** Watching $110 level. Note that this is the lowest it's been since September 2024. We have millions of shares come in in the first 2 minutes of the open so watch for that.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Not much to speak of that hasn't been said before, but NVDA is heavily affected by tariffs and the CHIPS Act, with additional scrutiny that it is somehow bypassing export controls and having their chips go into China.

**Risks:** MORE trade disputes, more potential export restrictions, (Trump has cited he wants to strengthen export controls for NVDA).

**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) / [FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d) / Other Chinese Stocks

**Catalyst:** China has imposed 15% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S. goods.

**Technicals:** $130 level. Most interesting level I'm watching today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Tariffs, stimulus from the Chinese government, China has been spending for increased consumer confidence. 

**Risks:** Even greater tariffs, the cash cannon that China is using dies down, less spending by Chinese consumers, etc.

> 
> Six weeks into his second term, the U.S. president has hit imports from Mexico and Canada with 25% levies, put an additional 20% tariff on goods from China, threatened reciprocal tariffs globally and cut off military aid to Ukraine.
> 
> But instead of the rising yields and higher dollar that investors had wagered on in November, the so-called ""Trump trade"" is in full retreat.
> 
> Trade conflict has begun in earnest and the dollar is falling while bond yields dive.
> 
> U.S. allies are rattled. As Goldman Sachs analysts note, the average tariff rate on imports from China is now 34% and the increase is already roughly twice as large as that in the first Trump administration. Nobody wants to bet anymore that there will be swift compromises or deals.

> ""In credit markets, spreads certainly look too low given the change in risk environment and a more adverse and uncertain trade backdrop.""
> 
> Volatility gauges for Treasuries (.MOVE), and for U.S. (.VIX), and Japanese stocks (.JNIV), hit their highest levels of the year this week and implied volatility in currencies ticked higher.
> 
> Stocks and bond yields slid on Tuesday as investors globally ducked for cover.
> 
> Defence stocks ran higher, while shares in technology companies slumped. As China announced retaliatory tariffs and Mexico and Canada prepared their responses, investors reckoned on a global growth slowdown and upped expectations for U.S. rate cuts.
> 
> Futures pricing still implies about 75 basis points of U.S. cuts this year, up from about 50 bps two weeks ago, while 10-year yields hit a 4-1/2 month low of 4.115%.
> 
> Investors see an uncertain outlook where shelter lies in defensive sectors such as real estate or healthcare. And, while protected companies such as U.S. steelmakers may prosper, higher prices will flow along supply chains with unpredictable effect.

> ""I'm spending a lot of time talking to CEOs who are really trying to understand the consequence of some of this,"" said Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon at conference in Australia.

> **DIFFICULT TO TRADE**
> 
> The fall in the dollar has been one of the most eye-catching reversals as conviction turns to confusion in currency trade.
> 
> What had, in January, been speculators' largest long-dollar bet in nearly a decade has rapidly unwound - so much so that, as of last week, speculators were short dollars against emerging market currencies and held a record long yen position .
> 
> Against the euro , the dollar is down nearly 1% in two trading sessions as the fall in U.S. yields has coincided with rises for European yields since the continent prepares to ramp up defence spending while Trump backs away from Ukraine.
> 
> At the White House, Trump took aim at China and Japan for holding their currencies too cheap. In fact, the yuan , against a basket of trading partners' currencies, is historically firm and Japan has been intervening in recent years to buy the yen .
> 
> But on Tuesday, as the dollar fell, Nomura's global head of foreign exchange flow, Hoe Lon Leng, said it seemed like the ""final blow"" for those hoping for a higher dollar.
> 
> ""That argument is waning and we keep seeing the price action move the other way,"" he said, noting that if both China and the U.S. did not want to see the dollar go higher against the yuan ""then it is going to go lower"".

> To be sure, market gyrations have not been enormous and plenty of analysts do still see room for trade negotiations and an exit ramp from escalation. But the policy whiplash has gnawed away at hopes investors had in a breakthrough deal.

* **Earnings per share**: $2.41 vs. $2.26 expected
* **Revenue**: $30.92 billion vs. $30.82 billion expected

Target’s net income for the three-month period that ended Feb. 1 was $1.10 billion, or $2.41 per share, compared with $1.38 billion, or $2.98 per share, a year earlier.

Sales dropped to $30.92 billion, down about 3% from $31.92 billion a year earlier. In the year-ago period, Target benefited from an extra week, which has skewed year-over-year comparisons.

For its current fiscal year, Target is expecting earnings per share to be between $8.80 and $9.80, which at the midpoint is more or less in line with estimates of $9.31, according to LSEG. However, it’s expecting sales to grow just 1%, well behind estimates of 2.6%, according to LSEG.

The overall earnings beat expectations but forward guidance has concerns about consumer health. With all tariffs, it's going to be interesting with inflation and consumer discretionary spending. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j38ruv/target_earnings_came_out_earnings_beat/,1741088019.0

1j2njk7,Is $CMPS a Bet Worth Taking? The Case for (and Against) COMP360,"Compass Pathways ($CMPS) is developing COMP360, a synthetic psilocybin treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The company’s Phase 3 program is the largest controlled psilocybin trial to date, but delays and operational shifts have raised questions about its trajectory.

The Bull Case:

	•	Strong early data: The Phase 2b trial showed that a single 25mg dose of COMP360 led to a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in depression symptoms at three weeks.

	•	Regulatory support: COMP360 has Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA and ILAP designation in the UK, signaling regulatory recognition of its potential.

	•	Unmet demand: TRD is a massive market with limited treatment options, creating an opportunity for novel approaches like COMP360.

The Bear Case:

	•	Delayed timeline: Compass recently pushed back its Phase 3 readout to mid-2025, raising concerns about execution risks.

	•	Financial pressure: The company announced a 30% workforce reduction, cutting costs but also signaling potential struggles in scaling operations.

	•	Single-drug reliance: Compass’s success is tied almost entirely to COMP360, meaning any regulatory setbacks or commercialization hurdles could be significant.

Final Thoughts

COMP360 could be a breakthrough treatment, but Compass Pathways faces real execution risks, a long regulatory road, and significant financial uncertainty. The next 12–18 months will be critical in determining whether the company can turn its promise into reality.

1j2lrln,"Trump, Chip Maker TSMC Expected to Announce $100 Billion Investment in U.S.","WASHINGTON—Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. 2330 -1.92%decrease; red down pointing triangle intends to invest $100 billion in chip-manufacturing plants in the U.S. over the next four years under a plan expected to be announced later Monday by President Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.

The investment would be used to build out cutting-edge chip-making facilities. Such an expansion would advance a long-pursued U.S. goal to regrow the domestic semiconductor industry after manufacturing fled largely to Asian countries in recent decades.

TSMC, the world’s largest contract chip-maker, set down roots in Arizona in 2020, when it said it would build a chip factory there for $12 billion. Its ambitions for the site have expanded rapidly since, with two more factories on the same site and a total investment of $65 billion. The company’s first factory began mass production late last year.

TSMC’s announcement comes after years of deliberation regarding the future of semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. and the global tech sector. The company currently builds its most advanced chip-making facilities only on its home soil Taiwan. The chips it produces are critical for powering everything from the latest artificial-intelligence systems to smartphones.

Since the Biden administration, the U.S. has expressed concerns about TSMC’s near-monopoly on advanced chip manufacturing and has been urging the company to relocate more of its cutting-edge production, including advanced chip-packaging facilities, to the U.S. Advanced chip packaging is particularly critical for AI-related chips, as it enhances performance by integrating multiple semiconductor components, reducing size, improving power efficiency, and ensuring faster data transfer—key factors for AI applications.

[awarded up to $6.6 billion of grants](https://www.wsj.com/tech/taiwanese-chip-making-giant-tsmc-gets-6-6-billion-for-arizona-project-f75e9de4?mod=article_inline), and has recently begun to receive federal money from the program. Generous tax credits have also boosted chip-making projects in the U.S.

“We’re pleased to have an opportunity to meet with the President and look forward to discussing our shared vision for innovation and growth in the semiconductor industry, as well as exploring ways to bolster the technology sector along with our customers,” TSMC said in a statement.

U.S. officials see chip-making as a national-security imperative because economies, technological advancement and military might all are increasingly dependent on who has the best chips. Covid-era supply-chain issues also highlighted the critical nature of the industry when shortages of chips led to slowdowns in auto sales, among other disruptions.

Trump has repeatedly called for more chip manufacturing in the U. S.—although he criticized the Chips Act on the campaign trail and argued the better way to attract manufacturing was through tariffs. Last month, he said he was considering a 25% or more tariff on semiconductor imports.

“We have to have chips made in this country. Right now, everything is made in Taiwan, practically, almost all of it, a little bit in South Korea, but everything—almost all of it is made in Taiwan. And we want it to be made—we want those companies to come to our country, in all due respect,” Trump said in February.

Since taking office, Trump has appeared at the White House with the chief executives of several companies to announce pledges to invest in the U.S. The details of the projects are often vague and it is often unclear whether the pledges represent [new investments by the companies](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-corporate-new-job-investment-what-to-expect-ad19993c?mod=article_inline).

1j2khkm,"Tesla sales plunges 70% in Norway, what might the future bring","Norway is a special market with almost 90% EV's with a market share of 18% for Tesla, so in other countries sales will most likely not decline as much in the same period since oversaturation is less of an issue. Norway can be a reference for other markets in the future but only if Tesla is able to clean up their reputation.

Since administration only started on the 21st, we will only see the real effect of decline in sales when numbers from March are published. Some other countries share car registrations which are from a time point a view much more reliable than sales, since it's unclear if this is about cars being delivered or ordered.

**Reasons of decline**

* (stronger) competition
* oversaturation of Tesla, people want to have another car as the rest
* customers possibly waiting for new Tesla Y 
* Musk

Although oversaturation is less of a risk in other countries, people still steer away from Tesla in favour of different, fresher designs. Tesla is focusing a lot on new tech gadgets/software, while their cars still almost look the same as many years ago.

**Conclusion and near future**

Although it's unclear if the numbers are deliveries or orders in February, we might see a further decline. People that  already decided to buy a Tesla are unlikely to cancel their order. In Norway we might see almost no sales anymore because until new Tesla Y rolls out. In other countries sales could plunge the same as in Norway.

If the decline of sales becomes a trend this will in the short term become a big logistic and manufactoring problem for Tesla. They'll have to start dealing with overstock, production might need to be halted since more production might just lead to more overstock.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j2khkm/tesla_sales_plunges_70_in_norway_what_might_the/,1741013870.0

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Tariffs will take place tomorrow, keep an eye out for that. Market vol will probably be higher than expected today. 

News: [Trump Heads Toward Tariff Barrage on Canada, Mexico, China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-02/trump-barrels-toward-tariff-barrage-on-canada-mexico-and-china)

**Ticker:** [**RKLB (Rocket Lab)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKLB&p=d)

**Catalyst:** ""Rocket Lab (RKLB) played a pivotal role in Firefly Aerospace's successful Blue Ghost Mission 1 lunar landing by providing its MAX Flight and MAX Ground Data Software suites, which managed critical functions such as commanding, telemetry, navigation, and control throughout all mission phases, including descent and landing.""

**Technicals:** We saw this stock move close to 25% on Friday, watching to see if we have more momentum coming in. This coupled with the catalyst from ASTS makes the entire spaceflight sector worth watching.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Whenever we see these stocks involved in a successful space launch we see them spike. Overall I find most of the catalysts a coin toss but interesting to see multiple on the same day.

**Risks:** Technical delays/failures in the future.

**Related Tickers:** LUNR, ASTS

**Ticker:** [**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)

**Catalyst:** AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) entered into a joint venture with Vodafone to establish ""SatCo,"" aiming to provide 100% geographic coverage across Europe by offering space-based cellular broadband connectivity directly to standard smartphones. Vodafone is a leading provider in Europe/Africa.

**Technicals:** Watching $30 level, interesting to see where this moves in conjunction with RKLB today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Same as RKLB, but this catalyst is considerably lower risk because it's not dependent on a launch.

**Risks:** Other than the JV getting cancelled, regulatory hurdles/competition.

**Related Tickers:** VOD, IRDM, GSAT

**Ticker:** [**IBIT (Various Crypto Stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBIT&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump announced that the US will include three lesser-known CCs in the strategic CC reserve.

**Technicals:** This has caused a bounce in CC related stocks.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Adding these would result in buying in the sums of likely hundreds of millions of dollars, resulting in a massive buying catalyst and for the stocks that hold/deal in them to rise as well. Also note that we've seen a MASSIVE selloff in those markets for the past 2 weeks.

**Risks:** Reversal of news, less than expecting buying, a different bad catalyst, etc.

**Ticker:** [**CPRI (Capri Holdings)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CPRI&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Prada is reportedly nearing a deal to acquire Versace, which is currently owned by Capri Holdings (CPRI).

**Technicals:** Don't know what the exact acquisition math is on this, but presumably the move is accurate and not mispriced ($1.6B). Watching to see what it'll do at open but I don't anticipate heavy volume or anything like that coming in.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Surprisingly this is a good deal for both fashion houses and allows competition with LVMH, one of the largest fashion houses in the world despite it being far smaller in comparison.

**Risks:** Merger cancellation/deal talks fall through, FTC interferes somehow again like it did when Tapestry tried to acquire CPRI.

**Related Tickers:** LVMUY (this trades OTC)

1j2jjk2,How do you find financial stats for companies?,"
I am very new to investing and just beginning to dabble in fundamental analysis.

But for some reason gleaning the financial stats of companies is extremely confusing because different websites provide different numbers? 

E.g the PEG ratio of ONON 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/onon/price-earnings-peg-ratios

https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/onon/statistics/

The numbers given are completely different. I’ve even seen one websitr give ONON a PEG ratio of ~0.8 which suggests that it’s undervalued at the moment. Even though the 2 aforementioned links gave a PEG ratio of above 1. 

Anybody can give input on a reliable source for these financial stats ? One that is free and which gives this data for companies worldwide (not just US companies etc) ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j2jjk2/how_do_you_find_financial_stats_for_companies/,1741011192.0
1j2ixfl,Will US-Ukraine Split will trigger Chinese invasion of Taiwan (TSM/NVDA related),"There's at least two possibilities: 

* Our divestment from Ukraine will give us more resources to deal with China militarily; or
* We're actually signaling to China that we are not interested in defending other countries.

Chinese invasion of Taiwan is always on the table, but some people think what happened on Friday at the White House has just raised that possibility dramatically.

For example, Cramer wrote an article over the weekend for his paid community where he said: 

* ""If I was Chinese President Xi Jinping, I would immediately move militarily on Taiwan, betting that President Trump may switch sides and back China.""

* ""If you disagree with that after Friday’s White House exchange with Zelenskyy, you need to soul search your position. To me, this could be a tremendous opportunity for the PRC to stop this whole game of export restrictions from the U.S. and just turn everything on its head by taking over the island and, along with it, the most important strategic asset in the world right now, Taiwan Semi.""

* ""In a world where Zelenskyy gets thrown under the bus for lack of gratitude and starting a war that he didn’t start, how can we defend an allegedly ungrateful Taiwan? Perhaps because, unlike Ukraine, there is something at stake economically?""

* ""Will President Trump’s advisers discuss the notion that if we care about keeping the Chinese from getting the latest and greatest Nvidia chips, we should care about Taiwan’s sovereignty? Will Trump be persuaded by even cowed generals and naïve national security advisers that Nvidia and Taiwan Semi are of strategic importance? Do they even know that?""

Of course Cramer is an entertainer and not a military strategist. But I'm curious what does the community think. Is the American handling of Ukraine increasing or decreasing China's resolve to invade Taiwan soon? Would you change your investment strategy based on your analysis?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j2ixfl/will_usukraine_split_will_trigger_chinese/,1741009362.0

I currently have short position against Rivian open. The thesis is simple, the EV market is not favorable under the Orange Man because he is a oil guy. In addition, there is a lot of competition in the car industry. Noone is really thriving at the moment.

1j1n0rb,How are certain stocks good and others bad if everything is priced in?,"I'm only beginning to learn how to invest so bear with me. But as I understand it, the market is already priced in based on known information to account for future variance and growth. So why are penny stocks, for instance, bad? If they were bad, shouldn't the price drop until the money needed to by the stock is worth the potential gains? Similarly, how can companies listed in spy be good? If they provided such consistent returns, wouldn't the prices of the stocks rise until their consistent gains are no longer worth the minute risk they pose?

In the end, if I just buy random stocks, shouldn't my expected growth be roughly the same as SPY? If there was some easy rule of thumb for investing, shouldn't enough people do it to jack the prices up until it isn't much better than investing randomly?

The only reason I can think of that this isn't the case is that there are people addicted to gambling who buy high risk stocks, and thats why stuff like penny stocks are bad stocks.

1j19zlc,Serious question: why do people think Tesla will survive?,"This isn't a highly technical question, but I think it is critical all the same. Why do people think Tesla will survive Musk?

Tesla is already grossly, wildly inflated beyond any other car company--and yes, it's still a car company--and has spent years failing to deliver FSD. That's starting to become a very, very large problem.

And Musk has now deeply and irrevocably alienated some 10-50% of potential investors and customers, some of whom were previously diehard Tesla fans. Those people are never buying a Tesla product. Ever. And you might think they are overreacting, or the salutes where just ""Roman,"" etc., but none of it changes the fact that they are forever boycotting Tesla.

The only two bullish arguments I can think of are, first, that Musk will create such uniquely amazing technology that everyone will forgive his indiscretions. But even if Musk has some unique, amazing magically technology--which he doesn't--who is going to use it? If Hitler has a monopoly on magic carpets, you don't reluctantly buy one. You just walk. Because if you buy the carpet, everyone else is going to think you're a Nazi. Even if you fire Hitler, no one is going to buy magic carpets from former Nazi carpet merchants, not for a very long time at least. And Tesla doesn't even have a monopoly. It's pretty far behind in some key areas.

The second argument would be that his affiliation with Trump will forever protect Tesla stock price. But Trump doesn't have a trillion dollars to give Musk, not that he would, and government largess isn't going to get you very far with extremely limited customers and investors.

So what's the case I'm missing here? Why wouldn't you short the hell out of this stock?

Edit: Thanks for the feedback, this has been productive. The best answer I'm seeing is that Tesla can get rid of Musk once he starts hurting the bottom line. That's a logical line of thought, but I think it is already too late. We shall see when and if it happens.

Edit 2: Friends, you don't have to do this, but please don't think Tesla will just be able to wash all of this with the right PR team and a new CEO. This isn't like Anheuser-Busch having a bad quarter because of a trans model. Tesla and its board apparently let a \*\*\*\* remain CEO. That's on Tesla, not just Musk. ""Never forget"" means never forget.

Edit 3: For stats: [32% of US car buyers today would not consider a Tesla versus only 17% in 2021](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2025/02/17/business/tesla-sales-elon-musk-politics); [Tesla favorability perception drops from 33% in 2018 to 9% by Jan. 2024 to 3% in Jan. 2025](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-sales-elon-musk-reputation-brand-damage-trump-doge/); [Tesla ranks least favorable among consumers interested in buying an EV](https://insideevs.com/news/749741/tesla-ev-buyers-favorability-rating/?utm_source=chatgpt.com); [Republicans like Musk but 48% don't like EVs](https://www.newsweek.com/republican-change-tune-elon-musk-not-tesla-2029028); [60% of UK car buyers refuse to consider a Tesla](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/01/30/uk-survey-finds-60-of-car-buyers-turned-off-by-elon-musk/); [one in three Dutch Tesla owners want to sell](https://insideevs.com/news/747944/tesla-owners-musk-survey-netherlands/), etc.

Those are brutal numbers. And maybe all of that damage can heal if Musk ever gets ousted. But with tightening competition, there's a point of no return.

Edit 4: Ok, so hard no on the ""but it isn't a car company"" angle. About 88-93% of Tesla's revenue is tied to automotive, meaning  it's actually more of a car company than other car companies, like, say, Volkswagen (15% financial services). Or BYD, which is \~80% automotive with the rest being electronics, energy, batteries, and semiconductors. So basically its a better Tesla.  And Tesla isn't a tech/AI/robot/home company for the same reason that McDonald's isn't: neither of them sell those products.

1j0umzm,What are some of your favorite under-the-radar stocks that had great earnings results this quarter?,"Just curious what stocks you all are following that had good earnings and aren’t getting enough attention? Or even popular companies that had good results but were misunderstood or weren’t met by with much enthusiasm by Wall Street? None of us have time to sift through hundreds of financial results, so combined, I’m willing to bet we can get a pretty good list of investing ideas here for others to do due diligence on. 

I’ll start with two I own:

PRCH 
Nearly 20% Revenue growth and becoming more profitable. Putting themselves in a position to be a very valuable player in insurance industry with the home data they provide. Recently were granted a reciprocal that will enhance profitability and are beginning to scale out the licensing of their data. At a market cap of just around 800M, I think this is way under-the-radar relative to the strong performance they put in last year.

HIMS
Definitely not an unknown or under-the-radar company anymore. I feel that this stock is still very much in price discovery mode. Admittedly there are concerns I have with this one as they attempt to disrupt big pharma, but they have built a strong brand, and I think the percentage of their total revenue that they generate from weight loss drugs is not proportional to the reaction from Wall Street on the news of the FDA banning them from compounding GLP1’s. This will not harm HIMS as much as people make it out to appear. Their other services and compounded treatments are the core of their revenue and have led to exponential revenue growth in 2024. There are many verticals within the healthcare space that they can continue to grow into. This is one of my highest conviction long term investments.

>

>We recently compiled a list of the [**Top 10 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/top-10-dividend-stocks-to-buy-according-to-hedge-funds-1464133/). We recently compiled a list of the [**Top 10 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/top-10-dividend-stocks-to-buy-according-to-hedge-funds-1464133/). In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other dividend stocks.

>The sustained high inflation over the past two years has resulted in increased borrowing costs, posing difficulties for both businesses and consumers. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding potential interest rate cuts by central banks, regulatory changes under the new US administration, and ongoing geopolitical tensions have further dampened economic activity. In this challenging landscape, competition for capital has intensified, with companies focusing on their competitive advantages and adjusting their strategies for both short-term stability and long-term growth to secure essential resources amid rising economic uncertainty.

>Dividends are becoming increasingly attractive in the current market environment. A report from S&P Global indicates that global dividend growth saw a significant boost in 2024, rising by 8.5%. This growth was especially notable in the Asia-Pacific region, where government policies encouraged companies to shift from annual to semiannual dividend distributions. Meanwhile, the US market experienced a surge in new and reinstated dividends, with the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sector playing a key role in driving this trend. The report also pointed out that over the past decade, companies across the broader market—excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs)—have, on average, distributed 85% of their discretionary cash flow (DCF), which is calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. On average, this distribution has been divided between dividends and share buybacks, with 47% allocated to dividends and 38% directed toward buybacks.

>Global dividend growth had been slowing since the post-COVID recovery, but that trend reversed last year, with the growth rate accelerating to 8%. Shareholders received approximately $180 billion more in payouts than in 2024, which came as a surprise given the prevailing geopolitical and economic uncertainties, according to an S&P Global report. The firm projects that total global dividend payments will remain at $2.3 trillion in 2025.

>Analysts point out that earnings growth has traditionally been the key driver of dividend increases. With strong earnings growth recorded last year, expectations for 2025 are even higher. Goldman projects an 11% rise in earnings per share this year, up from an estimated 8% in 2024, which is expected to drive a 7% increase in dividends, compared to a 6% rise last year. Meanwhile, Ohsung Kwon, a US equity strategist at BofA Securities, holds an even more optimistic view, forecasting a 12% dividend boost this year, supported by accelerating earnings growth.

>Historically, dividends accounted for 40% of the market’s total returns from 1936 to 2012, but their contribution has dropped to just 16% over the past decade, according to a BofA Securities research note published late last year. However, Kwon expects dividends to play a more substantial role in overall market returns moving forward. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks according to hedge funds.

>Our Methodology

>For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds and identified the top 10 companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders and have dividend yields of at least 1%, as of February 25. This means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend stocks among the elite hedge funds in America. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.

>Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ([**see more details here**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly)).

>Is Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) the Best Retirement Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

>A smiling baby with an array of baby care products in the foreground.

>Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:[JNJ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JNJ))

>Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 98

>An American multinational pharmaceutical company, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) ranks eighth on our list of the best dividend stocks according to hedge funds. The company has a diverse portfolio that includes over 10 high-performing drugs across multiple therapeutic areas, such as infectious diseases and oncology. In addition to its pharmaceutical business, the company is a major player in the medical device industry, providing further diversification. Its financial performance remains stable and reliable. Since the start of 2025, the stock has surged by nearly 15%.

>In the fourth quarter of 2024, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) reported $22.5 billion in revenue, marking a 5.2% increase from the prior year. As a prominent healthcare company, it remains focused on developing treatments for diseases with substantial unmet needs, including multiple myeloma, lung cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and heart failure. The MedTech division recorded a 6.2% rise in global operational sales, with acquisitions and divestitures contributing 1.5% to this growth. Strong demand for electrophysiology products and Abiomed supported growth in the Cardiovascular segment, while the General Surgery unit saw increased sales of wound closure products.

>Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s quarterly dividend currently comes in at $1.24 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.00%, as of February 25. The company maintains one of the longest dividend growth streaks in the market, spanning 62 years.

>Overall JNJ ranks 8th on our list of the dividend stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JNJ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the [**cheapest AI stock**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/cheapest-ai-stock-with-10000-return-potential/).In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other dividend stocks.

I'm actually working here at this LNG plant in Cameron, LA and we just finished replacing the harps inside all 5 boilers. Recently, VG released shares to the stock market and I've been buying some every week despite the price dropping from $25 to $14 a share. I believe it will go up in the future with the U.S. pushing to be the worlds largest LNG exporter. Theres also another VG plant that's being constructed in Plaquemine, LA. The plant that I'm working at here in Cameron is also getting ready to do an expansion with underground work being done as we speak. VG also announced that they will be going commercial in April. Today, they announced that they will be paying dividends to shareholders. I'm guessing that's the reason for the price to jump during lunch time.

1j0kfoh,How do you approach DCF models? My Perpetuity Growth vs. Exit Multiple valuation gap is huge,"Hey everyone,

I’m working on some DCF models, but I’m running into a major issue: the difference between the Perpetuity Growth Method and the Exit Multiple Method is always huge. When I use a reasonable long-term growth rate (e.g., 2-3%), I get a valuation that’s way lower than when I apply an exit multiple based on comparable companies. It makes my model feel way off, and I don’t know which method to trust more.

I know that both approaches have their drawbacks—PGM is sensitive to WACC and growth rate assumptions, while EMM depends on the chosen multiple—but the discrepancy I’m seeing is significant enough to make me doubt the whole valuation.

How do you handle this in your models? Do you lean more on one method? And what are the biggest mistakes that can cause a valuation to be skewed?

Would appreciate any insights!",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j0kfoh/how_do_you_approach_dcf_models_my_perpetuity/,1740782389.0
1j0hvzp,"If a stock doesn’t pay dividends, how is it not a Ponzi scheme?","After delving into crypto, it made me question the fundamentals of stocks as well.

With crypto almost all of it is effectively a ponzi in a broad sense because most of these coins have 0 inherent value or produce insignificant revenue and cannot justify its multi billion $ market cap

All the money from selling a coin is 99.999% coming from another holder

How is this any different than stocks with 0 dividends?

Legally, there’s regulation, stocks are tied to their company that produces revenue etc (makes it totally different than crypto ofc)

However, financially your gains from selling a stock come directly from another holders money, correct? A company may sell their shares and then use that money to grow the company, but that wealth generation doesn’t directly flow into the stock — it just so happens to after some speculation 

I’m strictly taking about the source of money here

People see earnings report and then speculate what the FMV is and then bid on the stock. If a company buys their stock, they are just participating in the bidding. The stock’s value is exclusively coming from buyers and the only thing that financially couples the stock and company is the buyer’s speculation looking at the companies potential 

Basically, the money you make from a stock with 0 dividends is directly coming from another buyer … how is this not a ponzi, financially speaking?

For example, if everyone tried to sell their stock, the people who sold last would end up losing money because the first sellers would drain the liquidity and the later sellers who may have $1000 before the sell off may end up with like $100. I’m not explaining anything new here ofc, just highlighting common ponzi characteristics 

Not criticizing, just trying to understand and correct any misunderstandings

1j0e9nq,What will happen in the next 9 months,"No one knows what will happen! That said, you can look at the risks and reasonably conclude that there is an elevated probability of a recession this year. 

1. Tariffs reducing int'l trade
2. General macro and fiscal uncertainty contributing to reduced consumer and business confidence, and thus reduced purchases and investments
3. DOGE-ification trend increases in private sector resulting in more layoffs, and higher unemployment
4. Came out of steepest and longest 10y/3o inversion late last year

So... I think the better question is what data points should we be focused on in the next several months to understand if the likelihood of a recession is increasing or decreasing. Personally I'm watching the below but am interested in other perspectives.

* 10y yields: Bonds are primarily an institutional market. If yields continue to fall then that is telling you what institutions, who have access to way more data, are thinking about the economy. Falling yields = recession more likely.
* Consumer confidence: This metric tracks recessionary activity well. If this continues to fall then we are in trouble.
* Commodity prices: There is plenty of noise here with tarrifs... but if you see copper and oil fall then that may be a sign of trouble.
* Large purchase spending (autos, appliances, etc): This is typically the first place you see hit at the start of a recession as people delay spending on large purchases first.

Of course if you are bogling then all of this is irrelevant to you. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j0e9nq/what_will_happen_in_the_next_9_months/,1740766385.0

>The struggling chipmaker announced Friday that construction on the first of its two factories — known as fabs — planned for New Albany is now expected to be completed in 2030 and begin operations between then and 2031. Construction of the second fab should be done in 2031 and operations should begin in 2032.

>Intel announced the project in January 2022 and broke ground eight months later at the site in Licking County, just northeast of Columbus. The first plant initially was due to begin operating in 2025, but the project has since been delayed by financial concerns, the departure of its CEO last December and other problems. The company was once a dominant force in the semiconductor industry but has been eclipsed by rival Nvidia, which has cornered the market for chips that run artificial intelligence systems.

>“We are taking a prudent approach to ensure we complete the project in a financially responsible manner that sets up Ohio One for success well into the future,” Naga Chandrasekaran, the executive vice president, chief global operations officer and general manager of Intel Foundry Manufacturing, stated in a message posted on Intel's website. “We will continue construction at a slower pace, while maintaining the flexibility to accelerate work and the start of operations if customer demand warrants.”

>Intel has received $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion in funding it was due as part of the federal CHIPS Incentives Program. At least $1.5 billion of that funding was set to go toward the New Albany project, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.

1j0a5pn,Rocket Lab's Stock Fell 25% This Week. Here's Why It's a Buying Opportunity.,"**Rocket Lab** (Nasdaq: RKLB) has gotten a lot of attention in recent years as ""the disruptor of the space economy."" 

First a bit of background. 

Its *Electron* rocket is already launching smaller satellites of up to 300 kgs into orbit, but it's also developing a much larger *Neutron* rocket that will carry entire satellite constellation payloads that weigh up to 10,000 kgs.

Most compare the company to SpaceX, though this isn't an apples-to-apples comparison. SpaceX is primarily launching its own satellites for Starlink satellite internet, and it's offering rideshare to anyone who wants to hop on for a ride. Rocket Lab is offering much smaller, dedicated launches for commercial customers and for government defense programs. But it's building a bigger rocket now, which might compete in some cases with SpaceX's Falcon.

So back to what's going on with the stock.

Rocket Lab caught some heat earlier this week after getting blasted by a short report from Bleecker Street Research. Short reports are often short-term financially-motivated, and this conveniently came out two days before Q4 earnings (which during the quiet period, where Rocket Lab couldn't respond).

The crux of the short report is that Neutron's development is taking longer than expected and that its unit economics might not be as advertised. BSR believes the combination of Neutron's debut launch being delayed and it capturing less revenue in its earliest launches will lead to a cash crunch.

BSR went on to disclose that they are short Rocket Lab, but they did not issue a price target of what they believe the stock is worth. [Here is a link to their full report](https://www.bleeckerstreetresearch.com/research/rklb) for anyone who might be interested.

And now, why this is a buying opportunity.

I personally am on my seventh iteration of a Rocket Lab discounted cash flow valuation model and **I am sticking to $23 per share as an objective fair value for Rocket Lab's stock.**

Rocket Lab admitted during Thursday's earnings that its Neutron debut is expected ""in the second half of 2025."" 

That's fine with me, as I'd rather see them get this perfect for the first launch rather than rushing things to hit the deadline. I even expect they'll discount the price of the first Neutron launch to be closer to $30 million (rather than $50 million as is generally expected).

The six or twelve month delay is negligible to the stock price. We're already know that Neutron will take time to ramp up and we aren't expecting more than a handful of launches during the first few years anyway. In a worst-case scenario, pushing the first Neutron launch out to late 2026 or even 2027 wouldn't result in more than a $4 per share impact to Rocket Lab's current price target (i.e. around $19 per share instead of $23).

[Here's a link to see all of my Rocket Lab research](https://7investing.com/company_name/rocket-lab/) and all of the assumptions I've used in my DCF.

Outside of potential Neutron delays, everything else numbers-wise pretty much aligned with my previous expectations. 

There are fewer Electron launches set-in-stone on the launch schedule for 2025, but there are also more of them purposely-unscheduled and reserved for the US Space Force's responsive program (which is higher revenue per launch but also demands a launch within 24 hours). Electron's revenue per launch on Electron in 2025 will also be \~3% higher than it was in 2024.

Within Space Systems (where Rocket Lab manufactures the satellites and components), backlog is ""lumpy"" but is still progressing nicely. New or updated contracts have been signed with the Space Defense Agency and Victus Haze, while the reveal of a new ""Flatellite"" design could be a perfect fit for upcoming constellations launched by Neutron.

I'd encourage anyone investing in Rocket Lab to look at what this company is accomplishing over long periods of time. Rather than putting any of their quarterly results under the microscope.   
  
**The punchline = I believe this week's selloff is likely a buying opportunity for longer-term investors.**

1j09c5p,Skype to Shut 14 Years After Microsoft’s $8.5 Billion Purchase,">Microsoft Corp. is signaling the end of the line for Skype, the iconic internet calling and chat service it bought almost 14 years ago.

>Once a byword for digital calls that bypassed long-distance charges, Skype was surpassed in recent years by smartphone-native communication apps and Zoom video calls. When Microsoft tried to stretch the Skype brand into the workplace, it lost out to Slack Technologies Inc.

>Microsoft’s response was to start from scratch and build Teams, a chat, voice and video communication service for the workplace, which gained ground as part of its software bundle. The Redmond, Washington-based company will offer Skype users the option of migrating to Teams, which is now its strongest rival to Salesforce Inc.-owned Slack, before it shuts down in May.

>“I’ve been at Microsoft for over 30 years, and there’s a lot of software that we’ve done that was incredibly valuable in its era, and then the next era came and it was the foundation,” said Jeff Teper, a Microsoft president who oversees communications and collaboration tools.

>Microsoft said there were more than 300 million monthly Skype users in 2016, but its daily user count had dwindled to 36 million in 2023. Teams, by comparison, has risen to 320 million monthly users.

>Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs, Skype at one time was owned by eBay Inc. and was in the hands of a private equity-led consortium when Steve Ballmer came knocking. The then-Microsoft boss made an uncharacteristically splashy bet on the market leader in online calls, paying $8.5 billion, a 40% premium to Skype’s internal valuation. The May 2011 deal was the largest acquisition by Microsoft at the time, and Skype became a key piece of its strategy for the emerging mobile age.

>It didn’t pan out as Ballmer would have hoped. Upstarts like Telegram, Snapchat, WeChat and WhatsApp solved problems that Skype didn’t. Microsoft’s center of gravity in corporate software ultimately ensnared Skype, which found itself in the Office division and under orders to build tools geared toward a workplace audience as well as a consumer one.

>By the time Slack arrived on the scene, Skype users were complaining that elements of the core experience had started to break down. They cited missed or phantom calls and failures to sync information on different devices. The company worked to improve the service’s reliability, but some loyal users were put off by frequent redesigns, including a short-lived effort to fashion Skype in the mold of Snapchat.

>Microsoft, which also saw its acquisition of Nokia Oyj’s mobile phone business end in failure, is far from alone in encountering rejection by a fickle consumer market. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has cycled through several iterations and brands for its online communications tools, which are today known as Chat and Meet. And this month, Amazon.com Inc. said it would be winding down Chime, the video and voice calling service it tried with little success to sell to corporate clients.

>The Windows maker is shuttering Skype to focus on developing new features for Teams, including artificial intelligence tools, Teper said. The company is working to infuse AI into its product suite, while keeping a lid on spending that isn’t part of that effort. It’s reassigning staff that had worked on Skype to other areas of the business and will not lay anyone off, Teper added.

>At one point, Skype played host to one of Microsoft’s biggest AI demonstrations: a real-time translator. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella had nudged researchers to bring the product to market as quickly as possible and heralded it as “magical” in a 2014 demonstration early on in his tenure.

>Teams is “going well and this is a step to double down on it,” Teper said, adding that Microsoft wanted to keep Skype running until it was confident that the Teams version for individual users was fully ready. “It’s the most successful product in its category by far,” he said.

**My Take:** Thank god. ZM might stand to be a major benefactor from this. MSFT already has Teams that serves as a workplace call tool, but Skype has tried to expand into the workplace forum space (like Slack) and has failed. MSFT is citing this more as a doubling-down on Teams rather than admitting ZM has eaten their lunch here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j09c5p/skype_to_shut_14_years_after_microsofts_85/,1740754076.0

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

A really weak point, almost impossible to overcome, is the way the cars are manufactured. The focus has been on building profitable cars, some of them huge in parts, which can seem very efficient, profitable and good for the investor. The problem is that these cars need to travel on the road and it is very easy to have an accident, even a minor one.  Large and small Tesla customers are realizing this. A small dent could lead to an accident and the car not being worth repairing.

1izzrny,Most online advice I’m seeing is to invest in an ETF or mutual fund and park. Why?,"I’ll say up front that I’m somewhat new to investing but I wasn’t exactly born yesterday. I follow several investing-related subreddits and subscribe to some YouTube channels and have much more secondhand information than I do experience but probably more information and experience than the average person you’d meet on the street. Still, hoping for some insight and clarity. 

I can’t seem to understand why investing in individual stocks is so frowned upon or ill-advised in so many forums. If you have stock you truly believe in and has proven itself historically (coca-cola, for example), why is that riskier than choosing any etf that likely already holds (coca-cola, for example)? If VOO, QQQ, and SCHD (and beyond!) all have the same stock, why is it riskier to invest solely in that one stock?  Can someone please ELI5?

Edit because wow some of you guys 😂 for clarity, I put around 20k into ETFs. They have consistently underperformed individual stocks since I have been in.

1izwe6v,Contrarian view (bullish on the market - especially tech stocks),"So I am thinking more and more about this market and so much of the negativity is due to the Trump tweet (or “truth”) of the day where he’s either amplifying his tariff talk or threatening one of our allies. The market overreacts and sells off great companies (e.g. NVDA today). But here’s what I think will happen:

Trump will announce that he’s come to a “beautiful, glorious deal” with the EU, Canada, Mexico, etc. and talk about reducing the tariffs that both sides charge each other. This will make the market POP big time because it will promote free trade. It will be especially good for US technology companies who have been hectored by the EU and outright banned or censored in parts of Asia.

Trump will then work with Xi to create a better trade situation with China in the second half of 2025, where our technology companies IP are protected and the Chinese manufacturing sector is also protected (there’s a reason that 30% of the US’ good are produced in China). He will also relax the export restrictions on US technology, allowing companies like Nvidia and MU to sell the Hell out of China, which will lead to a big pop again. 

Let’s face it, Trump has a huge ego. He’s not going to allow the stock market to tank in his first year. He ESPECIALLY is not going to allow it to tank tech stocks, where is he leaning so heavily on technology people like Musk, David Sacks and Peter Thiel. He even has a great relationship with Jensen Huang now. 

That’s my theory. I think it will remain choppy for the next couple of quarters but by Q3 CY2025, things should be rocking and rolling. I am DCAing BIG TIME into some great stocks in the AI and energy sector until then, while the prices are still relatively attractive.

[https://www.stocktitan.net/news/CLOV/clover-health-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-xqlhts1l2ne3.html](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/CLOV/clover-health-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-xqlhts1l2ne3.html)

Clover Health's 2024 results reveal a remarkable financial turnaround, with the company achieving **$70 million in Adjusted EBITDA** for 2024 compared to a **$42 million** loss in 2023 – a **$112 million** year-over-year improvement. This shift to profitability represents a critical inflection point for a company that has historically struggled with high medical costs.

The most telling metric is Clover's Insurance Benefits Expense Ratio (BER) improvement to **81.2%** for full-year 2024, down from **86.5%** in 2023. This 530 basis point improvement directly translates to approximately **$69 million** in additional margin on their **$1.3 billion** insurance revenue base. In the Medicare Advantage industry, where typical margins are thin, this level of medical cost improvement is exceptional.

Clover's 2025 guidance signals confidence in their business model, projecting **30%** membership growth and **37%** revenue growth while maintaining profitability. The upcoming 4.0 Star Rating for payment year 2026 will provide a substantial revenue boost through enhanced CMS reimbursements – typically 5% higher than non-bonus plans.

The company's technology-first approach with the Clover Assistant platform appears to be delivering on its promise of better care management and cost control. Their positive cash flow from operations in 2024 marks another critical milestone, reducing concerns about future capital needs.

While balancing rapid growth with profitability remains challenging in healthcare insurance, Clover's improved cost structure and technology platform position them to potentially achieve both objectives – something many Medicare Advantage startups have failed to accomplish.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1izrcpp/clov_1875b_projected_revenue_2b_market_cap_make/,1740692593.0

1izooi2,Some DD on European Defense Companies,"# Major European Defense Companies

# BAE Systems (UK)

* **Performance:** BAE Systems saw **sales grew 14% to £28.3 billion** in 2024, with underlying EBIT rising \~12%. EPS also increased from 63.2p to 68.5p, reflecting strong execution and higher profitability.
* **Backlog & Contracts:** The company’s **record-high backlog of £77.8 billion** (up 11% YoY) represents nearly three years of revenue visibility. It secured £33.7 billion in new orders, including significant contracts related to the AUKUS submarine pact and Eurofighter program.
* **Geopolitical Tailwinds:** With the UK increasing defense spending beyond 2% of GDP, BAE stands to benefit from ongoing investment in combat aircraft, naval ships, and nuclear submarines. It's previously been described as having **""the keys to the back door of Number 10 \[Downing Street\]""**
* **Valuation:** Currently trading at **21× earnings** (historical average \~14×), with a **1.5× P/S ratio and EV/EBITDA around 12–14×**. While some growth is priced in, there remains room for upside if European defense budgets continue expanding.

# Thales (France)

* **Performance:** Thales reported **record-high order intake of €23.1 billion** in 2023, lifting its **backlog to €47 billion** by mid-2024. Sales grew \~5%, with EBIT up \~10%, demonstrating strong operational performance.
* **Backlog & Contracts:** The company secured several contracts exceeding €500 million each, including deals for Rafale fighter systems, air defense radars, and a major 10-year French defense cloud project.
* **Geopolitical Factors:** With France increasing military spending and the EU pushing for greater defense self-sufficiency, Thales is well positioned in aerospace, cyber-security, and defense electronics.
* **Valuation:** Thales trades at a **P/E of 28× and an EV/EBITDA of 13–15×**, higher than historical norms, suggesting much of the expected growth is might be reflected in its stock price.

# Leonardo (Italy)

* **Performance:** Leonardo posted **double-digit growth in 2024**, with **revenues up 11% to €17.8 billion** and EBITA rising 13%.
* **Backlog & Contracts:** Its **order backlog now exceeds €44 billion**, with strong bookings for helicopters, Eurofighter Typhoon exports, and defense electronics.
* **Growth Drivers:** As Italy increases defense spending toward NATO’s 2% target, Leonardo is set to benefit from major defense programs. Additionally, its ownership of Leonardo DRS provides access to U.S. military contracts.
* **Valuation:** Still trading at **20× earnings and only \~1× sales**, despite it's recent impressive runup, Leonardo appears to still be undervalued compared to peers. If it continues improving margins and cash flow, there is **significant room for multiple expansion**.

# Rheinmetall (Germany)

* **Performance:** Rheinmetall transformed into a **rapidly growing pure-play defense leader**, with **sales up 30–40% and profits doubling** in 2023.
* **Backlog & Contracts:** The company’s **order backlog soared to €52 billion by Q3 2024**, nearly five times its annual revenue. Major wins include a **€8.5 billion artillery ammunition deal**, a **€3.5 billion military truck order**, and expanding production in air defense and armored vehicles.
* **Geopolitical Momentum:** Germany’s €100 billion defense modernization effort provides a long-term growth runway for Rheinmetall, particularly in armored vehicles, artillery, and munitions.
* **Valuation:** The stock trades at over **80× earnings,** with an insane recent run. While its backlog supports long-term growth, **valuation risk is high**. I'd probably wait for a pullback on this one but what do I know, I wouldn't have bought Tesla either.

# Saab AB (Sweden)

* **Performance:** Saab delivered **23% organic sales growth** in 2024, with **EBIT up 32% and revenue reaching SEK 63.7 billion (\~$6.2 billion)**.
* **Backlog & International Demand:** Its **order backlog grew 22% to SEK 187 billion (\~$17 billion)**, supported by strong exports of anti-tank weapons, radars, and Gripen fighter upgrades.
* **Growth Outlook:** With Sweden increasing defense spending and expanding its NATO role, Saab is well-positioned. Demand for its Carl-Gustaf anti-armor weapons and air defense radars continues to surge.
* **Valuation:** Saab trades at **35–40× earnings**, above its historical average (\~23×). While it has strong international demand, much of its near-term growth is already priced in.

# Under-the-Radar EU Defense Companies

# Hensoldt (Germany)

* **Specializes in defense electronics (radars, optronics, electronic warfare).**
* **Backlog of €6.64 billion** (up 20% YoY).
* **Revenue grew 21% in 2024**; targets €5 billion annually by 2030.
* **Undervalued vs peers despite critical role in surveillance & air defense.**

# QinetiQ Group (UK)

* **Provides defense R&D, robotics, and test & evaluation services.**
* **Backlog of £2.9 billion**, growing internationally.
* **P/E \~16× (trailing), \~12× (forward).**
* **Niche in high-tech defense solutions, with strong cash flow.**

# Chemring Group (UK)

* **Specializes in munitions, countermeasures, and explosive detection.**
* **Backlog of £1.35 billion, revenue up 8% in 2024.**
* **P/E in mid-teens, trading at a discount vs larger defense firms.**
* **High demand for its battlefield tech and missile countermeasures.**

# Kongsberg Gruppen (Norway)

* **Leading missile and air defense supplier in Europe.**
* **Backlog of NOK 88 billion (\~$8.5 billion).**
* **Major supplier of NASAMS air defense system and Naval Strike Missile.**
* **Strong growth potential as NATO nations standardize on its weapons.**
* **Increased Arctic military interest could mean it's a good speculative Arctic play**

# Conclusion/Outlook

With **record order backlogs and rising military budgets**, European defence is likely to see a rather **significant boom**. Fears of a complete **NATO collapse aside**, EU leaders including **Macron and Germany's new chancellor** are increasingly open and pushing for a **European army**, as it's clear the age of reliance on US defence is coming to an end. I'm going to be creating a mini-etf with these stocks (allocations pending) and seeing how they perform over the next few years.

**TLDR**:

* **Leonardo and BAE Systems** appear **undervalued** relative to their peers.
* **Thales, Saab, and Rheinmetall** have strong growth, but their stocks already reflect much of the upside.
* **Smaller players like Hensoldt, QinetiQ, and Chemring** could offer better risk-reward opportunities.

Given the rapid evolution of defense spending, **selecting stocks with solid backlogs and reasonable valuations** will be key to capturing underappreciated upside.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1izooi2/some_dd_on_european_defense_companies/,1740685765.0
1iznm3n,"Tesla seeking approval to offer ride-hailing services in California, Bloomberg News reports","Tesla is seeking approval to offer ride-hailing services in California, a key step by Elon Musk's company to begin carrying paying customers while its traditional car-selling business falters, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.

The automaker has approval to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver in California, but it does not have, nor has applied for, a driver-less testing or deployment permit from the state's Department of Motor Vehicles, according to the report.

Tesla late last year applied for a transportation charter-party carrier permit from the California Public Utilities Commission, the report said, citing documents. That classification means Tesla would own and control the fleet of vehicles.

The company discussed driver's license information and drug-testing coordination in its communications with California officials, suggesting that Tesla intends to use human drivers, at least initially, the report said.

Tesla and the California Public Utilities Commission did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Musk has in the past year pivoted Tesla to robotaxis as demand slows for its aging line-up of electric vehicles — a high-stakes bet that has lifted shares but could face regulatory roadblocks. Investors are counting on the billionaire's close ties to U.S. President Donald Trump to simplify that process.

Musk had in October said Tesla will roll out driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas this year, without offering more specific details.

Tesla had in the same month revealed a concept for a robotaxi called Cybercab that will come without a steering wheel or control pedals, as it looks to dominate the self-driving vehicle industry.

Musk has said Tesla will start fully unsupervised FSD in Texas and California this year, without offering more details. He said the Cybercab will go into production in 2026 and will also be available for customers to buy for less than $30,000.

However, with autonomous technology proving harder and more expensive to solve, industry experts have warned it could take Tesla several years to commercialize a robotaxi.

- Tesla 
- Shopify 
- Block
- NVDA 
- AMD 
- PLTR
- AAPL

I know everyone in the comments is going to claim this is selection bias, but I can assure you these stocks were talked about so much it is unmistakable. People will also claim but these stocks have tanked since then! They have had significant corrections, but if you bought them when the buzz began you are still significantly in the green.  We will have to wait and see what the future holds. 

 But what about the losers like movie pass!? Of course, some losers have been overly hyped too, but they are far less common. Also, in my opinion, the tone around stocks like movie pass is totally different than a stock like NVDA or SHOP. 

The beautiful part about Reddit is you hear both sides, SHOP had a great deal of resistance back in 2017 and still does. A lot of people claimed it was a worthless company. People like Andrew Left were worshipped for shorting the company. But at the end of the day it was posted about non stop and has performed extremely well. People were also screaming from the top of the mountain that NVDA was overpriced in 2017, look where that ended up. 

Lately it feels like we have entered a new “hype” cycle where a lot of new names have been heavily mentioned. Similar to the hype cycle of 2016-2017 there is a lot of resistance and great discussions behind had. Here are some new names that I have noticed being posted about non stop: 

- RKLB
- IONQ 
- BBAI
- CAVA 
- LUNR
- SMCI
- OKLO

1izhdwe,Could RDDT join S&P 500 in 2025-2026?,"I think RDDT is going into that ""mature company"" phase focused on profitability that could tip it into the S&P sometime later this year or early next. 

Reddit grew a lot since IPO (May of last year) off monetizing ads and is around $30B mcap now (off its $40B highs). The worst case scenario at this point for Reddit is that it stops growing ads and gets to the industry mean \~10x price/sales (so around $20B mcap off \~$2b in sales).

Reddit also hit net income and free cash flow profitability in the past 2 quarters, which means Reddit has a outsized change to get included into the S&P 500. Let's go through all the criteria:

  
1. Market cap - Needs to be a minimum $14.5B. Reddit is firmly above that at $30B and worst case imo is $20B if hypergrowth stalls

2. Liquidity - Needs to have traded 250k shares per month for 6 months (well over this threshold, last 30 days is 6.2M)

3. Domiciled in the US - check

4. Must have positive GAAP earnings for the past 4 consecutive quarters (we're two quarters in so far)

5. 10% of shares must be publicly traded -  \~80% of shares are publicly traded at the moment (\~100M of \~125M)

6. Sector balance - This might be a tricky one, since tech is already over 25% of the S&P 500. But there are a few tech companies at the bottom of the index that might tip Reddit in (like Sandisk)

7. Must trade for 12 months - we'll come up on that this summer

8. Corporate structure - check

  
I doubt that RDDT's management will let it tip into not being profitable - they have enormous R&D expenses already and I don't see that growing more. 

I've been holding RDDT since $55 and think this could hit $300 potentially with an S&P 500 catalyst and continued growth in revenue",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1izhdwe/could_rddt_join_sp_500_in_20252026/,1740667547.0

I bought an NVDA call option earlier this week at a $140 strike, expiry 2/28. It's been down and my option was around 2.2, I believe. Then earnings hit and I see during after hours and at market open, NVDA is up yet my option price is down further than the previous day when NVDA was hovering around 129-130.

News: [Nvidia Gives Upbeat Forecast In Sign That AI Build Out Is Strong](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/nvidia-gives-upbeat-forecast-in-sign-that-ai-build-out-is-strong)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings with EPS of $0.89 vs. $0.84 exp and revenue of $39.33B vs. $38.05B exp.

Provided strong guidance, anticipating revenue of $43B vs  $41.78B exp.

Performance is driven by robust demand for Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips, positioning the company to maintain its growth trajectory in the AI sector.

Overall a good earnings report, we're not going to see the stock explode like we did previously with the earnings beats.

**Technicals:** Watching $135 level, other than that I don't anticipate a major selloff due to the earnings news- maybe due to the jobs/macro news instead.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Overall not as explosive as the market wanted it to be. Growth was largely driven by advancements in AI (as usual).

Company said they were still demand constrained, even with export controls.

**Risks:** Potential supply chain disruptions/geopolitical tensions, greater export controls as mentioned previously, and increased competition.

**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM

**Ticker:** [**APP (AppLovin)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=APP&p=d)

**Catalyst:** A recent short report has been released, alleging that the company's application functions as spyware.

This follows a similar report from approximately a week ago.

**Technicals:** Yesterday I was mainly interested in being long if we broke $300 and had a recovery- I read both of the short reports and they said very similar things, so I thought the selloff was overblown.

Bought a little below $290, still holding. Will likely bail if we break $300 again.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** APP is a mobile tech company that helps devs market/monetize their apps through mobile advertising and marketing platforms, recently announced they were using AI.

**Risks:** The short report allegations are true and they essentially get banned from the Google App/Apple App Store.

**Related Tickers:** SNAP, PINS, TTD

**Ticker:** [**MRNA (Moderna)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRNA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** U.S. health officials are reevaluating a $590 million contract awarded to MRNA for bird flu vaccines.

**Technicals:** We saw a decent dip (roughly 5%) in MRNA afterhours yesterday, not too interested in this further unless we see further headlines about the contract being pulled completely.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** MRNA had massive growth during 2020 for being one of the main manufacturers of the COVID vaccine- right now bird flu is being touted as the next potential big pandemic to vaccinate against.

**Risks:** Cancellation is the the real catalyst after this news, or if the contract is awarded to a different company.

**Related Tickers:** PFE, NVAX

**Ticker:** [**SNOW (Snowflake)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d)

**Catalyst:** SNOW beat expectations, EPS of $0.30 vs. $0.18 exp. and revenue of $986.8M vs. $957.6M exp.

The company also provided an optimistic outlook, projecting current-quarter product revenue between $955M-$960M, driven by increasing demand for AI-related products.

**Technicals:** Interested in $190 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SNOW is a cloud-based data warehousing company and benefits from the demand for AI/ML solutions.

AI is compute intensive which means they can charge more for their services. Also announced integration with Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service.

**Risks:** SNOW doesn't generate GAAP profits still, data breaches, competitors, etc.

1izgkwe,"Trump says Mexico, Canada tariffs will start March 4, plus additional 10% on China",">President Donald Trump on Thursday said that his proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada will go into effect on March 4, and that China will be charged an additional 10% tariff on the same date.

>The sweeping 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada had been paused on Feb. 3 for one month. But the Trump administration had recently sown confusion about whether they would go back into effect when the delays expired.

>In a Truth Social post Thursday morning, Trump clarified that they would.

>He claimed that illicit drugs “are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,” despite pledges from both U.S. neighbors to boost their efforts to police their borders.

>“We cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,” Trump wrote.

>He also announced that China, which already faces 10% U.S. tariffs on its imports, “will likewise be charged an additional 10% Tariff on that date.”

>Trump added, “The April Second Reciprocal Tariff date will remain in full force and effect.”

**My take:** This news was released at  around 8:51 AM PT. I watched VXX, (VIX ETF),  BABA, FXI, SPY, plus other trade war participants that would be most affected. Interested mainly in triple levered ETFs like UPRO or YINN at the open to see if there's more volatility coming in (which there likely will be). This is somewhat of an incremental headline because we've seen Trump announce tariffs before but we never knew if they were a bluff or not, but today's tweet might be confirmation that this is actually happening (unless yet again, this is a bluff).

The trade for most of these catalysts is mainly just waiting with your hands on the keyboard and waiting for most of these tweets and being quick on the draw. I traded when Trump was president back in 2016-2020 and read close to every tweet he made.

**I'm most interested in BABA on the news because we're already so over extended from the Chinese government's announcement of liquidity measures yesterday (it was what resulted in the 4% spike yesterday).**",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1izgkwe/trump_says_mexico_canada_tariffs_will_start_march/,1740665251.0

1izfnba,Nvidia’s auto segment revenue surges to record high on demand for driver-assist tech,"U.S. chipmaker Nvidia’s auto segment revenue more than doubled in the latest quarter to a record high on strong demand for driver-assist software.

While the company’s biggest revenue stream by far is chip systems that power artificial intelligence, Nvidia has predicted its products that power driver-assist technology could become its next “billion-dollar” business.

Revenue of Nvidia’s automotive and robotics segment rose 103% year on year to $570 million in the fourth quarter of the 2025 fiscal year. That brought the segment’s revenue for the fiscal year to $1.69 billion, above $1 billion for a second-straight year.

The latest increase in revenue was due to to sales of Nvidia’s “self-driving platforms,” according to the company’s CFO.

“This growth highlights Nvidia’s increasing exposure to powering ADAS, autonomous vehicles, and robotics through its DRIVE platform and related technologies,” Brady Wang, semiconductor analyst at Counterpoint Research, said in an email.

CEO Jensen Huang said in Nvidia’s earnings call the company expects that “every single one” of the 1 billion cars on the roads today “will be robotic cars” that collect data which Nvidia-supported AI systems can help refine, according to a FactSet transcript.

Automotive and robotics is “getting ready to take off,” likely due to investments in autonomous vehicles such as Waymo and Tesla, Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said in an email. Munster also estimated that around 15 companies are building humanoid robots, potentially increasing demand for Nvidia chips.

“The performance of that segment is an important story below the fold that’s not getting much attention because it’s small,” he added, “but they can be a much bigger part of revenue going forward.”

Autos and robotics unit currently accounts for 1.45% of Nvidia’s total revenue.

Counterpoint’s Wang expects this growth to continue with Nvidia’s “increasing adoption of L2+ and more advanced systems”.

Several Chinese electric car companies, including BYD, Nio and Zeekr, use Nvidia’s driver-assist chip systems.

“In addition to autonomous driving, I also anticipate that robotics and physical AI will experience a hype,” Wang added, “followed by real-world applications in the coming years, sustaining the long-term growth of this sector.”

1izfe6e,"WBD adds 6.4 million Max subscribers, forecasts 150 million subs by end of 2026","Warner Bros. Discovery said Thursday it added 6.4 million global streaming subscribers in the fourth quarter for a total of 116.9 million subscribers.

Fourth-quarter revenue for the streaming segment, which is anchored by flagship service Max, totaled $2.65 billion, up 5% from $2.53 billion in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the unit came in at $409 million, compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $55 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.

In a shareholder letter, the company forecast adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion for its streaming business for the year — roughly double the $677 million adjusted EBITDA it reported for 2024 — and said it has a “clear path” to hit 150 million global subscribers by the end of 2026. Max is set to launch on television service Sky in the United Kingdom and Ireland by the second quarter of 2026, and will debut in Germany and Italy in the first quarter of that year.

The media and entertainment company announced Wednesday that Max would keep its B/R Sports and CNN content available at no additional cost to subscribers in its standard and premium tiers. Initially WBD planned to charge an additional cost for sports.

However, it will pull both verticals from its basic, ad-supported tier beginning March 30.

WBD’s overall fourth-quarter revenue fell 2% to $10.03 billion from $10.28 billion during the same quarter in 2023. Full-year 2024 revenue came in at $39.32 billion, down 5% from $41.32 billion in 2023.

Warner Bros. Discovery reported a net loss of $494 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, or a loss of 20 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $400 million, or a loss of 16 cents per share, during the fourth quarter of 2023.

TV networks revenue came in at $4.77 billion, compared to $5.04 billion in the year-earlier period. The company previously wrote down $9.1 billion for its networks business in its 2024 second-quarter earnings report. In its shareholder letter, Warner Bros. Discovery noted that it expects further declines in cable subscribers and that the advertising market for U.S. linear television is shrinking faster than expected.

For the studios business, fourth-quarter revenue totaled $3.66 billion, an increase of 15% from $3.17 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023.

I never got an explanation for being fired or severance or anything, I just got axed right before Christmas and thanked for all the work I did. I asked why I was being fired and got no answer. Are these stocks really not worth anything? Does the fact that he did this to get out of paying into retirement change anything? Is there anything I can do?

1iz3qu5,"Salesforce misses on revenue, issues disappointing guidance","Salesforce reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue on Wednesday and issued a forecast that fell short of analysts’ estimates. The stock price slipped 4% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did compared with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.78 adjusted vs. $2.61 expected

Revenue: $9.99 billion vs. $10.04 billion expected

Revenue increased 7.6% from a year ago in the quarter that ended Jan. 31, according to a statement. Net income rose to $1.71 billion, or $1.75 per share, from $1.45 billion, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier.

The top category of subscription and support revenue was service, at $2.33 billion. The figure was up about 8% and below the $2.37 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. In the sales category, Salesforce generated $2.13 billion in revenue, up 8% and also trailing Visible Alpha’s consensus of $2.17 billion.

During the quarter, the company introduced its second-generation Agentforce artificial intelligence agent technology, which answers employee questions in the Slack team communications app.

Salesforce said it has completed more than 3,000 paid deals involving Agentforce since October. Agentforce has gotten involved in 380,000 conversations through Salesforce’s help website, with humans getting involved in 2% of cases, according to the statement.

“A lot of other vendors are talking about their agent capabilities, but few are able to show that they’ve got this really running at scale,” co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff said on a conference call with analysts.

Agentforce will make a modest contribution to revenue in fiscal 2026, with a larger effect in the following year, said Amy Weaver, Salesforce’s outgoing finance chief.

Benioff referred to a forthcoming product in the area of information technology service management, where ServiceNow operates.

The U.S. Department of Government Efficiency is using Slack, Benioff said.

“We’ll work closely with the government,” he said. “We’ll do anything we can to help them succeed.”

The company called for $2.53 to $2.55 in adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal first quarter, with $9.71 billion to $9.76 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had anticipated adjusted earnings of $2.61 per share, with $9.9 billion in revenue.

For fiscal 2026, Salesforce is targeting $11.09 to $11.17 in adjusted earnings per share on $40.5 billion to $40.9 billion in revenue, implying 7.4% growth. The LSEG consensus was for adjusted earnings per share of $11.18 on $41.35 billion in revenue.

As of Wednesday’s close, Salesforce shares are down about 8% so far in 2025, while the S&P 500 index has gained about 1%.

1iz0pff,Wrote this about the US economy...,"Anyone who saw the latest poll on consumer confidence should know one thing: The American people are scared.

A friend of mine said: “If the American people can suffer some short-term pain, the DJT will go down as the greatest President has ever had”.

To invoke a line from Speed: “Pop Quiz, Hot-Shot…When have you ever known the US population to be willing to take some short-term pain in the last 60 years?”

For me, I don’t think they’ve been willing to do that since World War II, and that’s saying something.

So when the Consumer Confidence Index — a key measurement of how people are feeling about their pockets (basically) — falls to 98.3 and down 7% since last month.

People are fearing a bloodbath. For their homes. For their wallets. For their futures.

“Of the five components of the Index, only consumers’ assessment of present business conditions improved, albeit slightly. Views of current labor market conditions weakened. Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a ten-month high,” Stephanie Guichard, senior member of the Conference that issued the statement.

The labor market conditions wouldn’t be too bad if people were willing to get off their butts and replace all the undocumented workers who have been piled off back to their homes in the back of an armored truck and work in construction or farming, but people aren’t willing to do that.

Of course Johnny American is worried about future income. All companies seem to be doing is firing, firing, firing, firing and more firing, because they want to be please their beloved shareholders.

And the 401Ks — a way of almost guaranteeing their future happiness — are getting eroded while their credit card debts [are flying upwards](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc).

Simply telling people to throw in some beans and hope they’ll come out magic soon is quite simply a bad idea.

Food prices are expected to rise again in 2025, and the price of eggs — something that’s given a lot of headlines and used by the Democrats as a way of thumping Donnie but isn’t actually his or ANYONE’S fault — continues its exponential rise ($8-a-dozen, and you can’t kill off all the chickens in America).

One of the biggest employers in America — the construction industry (8 million workers — is on its knees at the moment. Among what is happening is that housing companies are blaming labour costs. That’s because of the difference between how many jobs have been lost thanks to Homeland Security, and how many visas have been produced. Combined with the fact that people are scared for their future, it’s a perfect storm.

The other reason is why people are scared — and you’ve guessed it — is AI. A [very recent poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2025/02/25/u-s-workers-are-more-worried-than-hopeful-about-future-ai-use-in-the-workplace/) by Pew Research said that 52% of US workers are scared crapless about computers taking their jobs. The techbros who try and tell you that there will be loads of jobs around the AI space are actually lying, it seems. 6% of the current workforce thinks that AI will create more job opportunities for them in the long-run, and 32% said that it will make for less. And the middle bit are lying to themselves.

And worse — the guys at the top have done absolutely nothing to reassure them. I’m sorry, but blasting out a few tweets isn’t going to help the American people in their immediate problems.

The current administration needs to work out how to get people happier about their current situations now, before it gets worse.

1iyyq59,"Instacart suffers steepest drop on record after disappointing revenue, lackluster forecast","Instacart’s stock had its worst day on record, slumping 12% after the grocery delivery company posted a fourth-quarter revenue miss and offered light guidance for the current period.

Prior to Wednesday’s move, the stock’s biggest one-day slump came in November, when it dropped 11%.

Instacart reported fourth-quarter revenue of $883 million, falling short of the $891 million average analyst estimate, according to LSEG. The company said it anticipates adjusted earnings of between $220 million and $230 million for the first quarter, below a consensus forecast of $237.1 million.

Gross transaction value, which measures the value of products sold, will come in between $9 billion and $9.15 billion in the quarter, compared to a FactSet estimate of $9 billion. Instacart said it expects average order growth to decline due to restaurant orders and its $0 delivery fee on minimum $10 baskets.

When Instacart held its Nasdaq debut in September 2023, it became the first notable venture-backed company to go public in the U.S. in about two years, as the market adjusted to soaring inflation and rising interest rates.

The company, whose official corporate name is Maplebear, closed its first day on the market with a roughly $11 billion market cap, down from its $39 billion private market valuation in 2021 during the Covid pandemic.

The stock peaked at $53.15 on Feb. 19, after rallying 76% last year. It closed on Wednesday at $42.80.

Eli Lilly plans at least $27 billion in new U.S. manufacturing investments","Eli Lilly on Wednesday said it will invest at least $27 billion to build four new manufacturing sites in the U.S., as demand for its blockbuster weight loss and diabetes injections soars and the company develops new drugs for other conditions.

It comes as drugmakers and companies across different industries work to build goodwill with President Donald Trump, who has emphasized reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains. He has threatened companies — and pharmaceutical businesses in particular — with tariffs if they do not manufacture products in the U.S.

Eli Lilly made the announcement at an event in Washington, D.C. — emphasizing the political undertones of the strategy. The event featured several speakers from the Trump administration, including Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who explicitly tied the announcement to Trump’s policies.

Lutnick said the investment is “exactly what the Trump administration is all about, which is building and manufacturing and reshoring in America, investing in America, building in America.” He thanked Eli Lilly for “doing exactly what the president was hoping would happen.”

Lutnick added that “if you want to understand the tariff policy” of the U.S., “I have just articulated it.”

The move brings Eli Lilly’s total U.S. manufacturing investments to more than $50 billion in recent years. The other $23 billion is from the company’s investments in new plants and site expansions since 2020, which has helped ease supply shortages of its popular drugs.  

“This represents the largest pharmaceutical expansion investment in U.S. history,” Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said at the event. “We’re making these investments ... to prepare for the demand we anticipate for future pipeline medicines across our therapeutic areas.”

Shares of the company rose more than 1% on Wednesday.

Three of the future U.S. sites announced Wednesday will manufacture active ingredients in medications, such as tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s obesity drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Ricks noted that there is a “real gap in supply chain in the U.S. as it relates to active ingredient availability in our country.”

The fourth site will extend the company’s global manufacturing network for future injectable therapies, he added.

Eli Lilly has not decided on where the four new U.S. sites will be located, Ricks said. The company will be accepting location submissions through March 13 and will announce decisions on new sites in the coming months.

Eli Lilly said the four new sites will create more than 3,000 jobs for workers such as engineers and scientists, along with 10,000 construction jobs as the plants are built. The company’s other U.S. plants include sites in North Carolina, Indiana and Wisconsin.

The new investments aren’t solely dedicated to Eli Lilly’s current and future obesity and diabetes treatments. The company is charting its future beyond Zepbound and Mounjaro, with hopes to deliver drugs from its broad pipeline of products for cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and other conditions.

Ricks said the company is optimistic about its pipeline across therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic health, oncology, immunology and neuroscience.

Still, the new investments build on the success of Zepbound and Mounjaro, which share dominance of the booming market for so-called GLP-1 drugs with Novo Nordisk’s weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic. Some analysts expect the global obesity drug market to be worth more than $150 billion annually by the early 2030s, making it critical for both companies to maintain their share as other drugmakers scramble to join.

During the event, Ricks took a shot at cheaper compounded versions of its injectable drugs, saying “America faces a growing threat from an influx of counterfeit and compounded medications.”

Eli Lilly’s efforts to boost the supply of Zepbound and Mounjaro aim to ensure that eligible patients are safely accessing those branded treatments instead of cheaper compounded versions. Patients flocked to those unapproved copycats when the branded drugs were in short supply, or if they didn’t have insurance coverage for the costly treatments. 

The FDA has since declared the shortage of tirzepatide over, which will essentially bar many compounding pharmacies from making copycats. 

Hassett said the issue also “disturbs the White House” because offshore producers of copycat drugs are “threatening lives in the U.S.”

1iyrlvl,Amazon unveils long-awaited Alexa revamped with AI features,"Amazon on Wednesday announced a long-awaited overhaul of its Alexa digital assistant, and it will charge a monthly subscription fee to access it.

The revamped service, which Amazon is calling “Alexa+,” is powered by generative artificial intelligence, Panos Panay, the company’s senior vice president of devices and services, said on stage at an event in New York.

For the first time, Amazon will charge users to access the revamped Alexa+. The service will be $19.99 a month, or free for Amazon Prime members, and it will roll out next month.

Alexa+ will work on “almost every” Alexa device the company has shipped, Panay said.

“Every once in a while, a technology comes around and it changes everything,” Panay said. ”\[Large language models\] enter the stage and fundamentally change the way we think about AI...It’s shaken up everything.”

Alexa+ can purchase concert tickets, order groceries, book dinner reservations and give recipe suggestions tailored to specific people in a user’s household, among other tasks. It can also read study guides, then quiz users on the answers, as well as organize handwritten documents and recall information from them.

“She’ll learn the rhythm of your life and proactively take action with you,” Panay said.

Daniel Rausch, Amazon’s vice president of Alexa and Fire TV, said on stage that Alexa has undergone a “complete re-architecture” as part of the upgrade.

“It is not as easy as taking an LLM and jacking it into the original Alexa,” Rausch said.

Alexa+ uses a “broad range of state-of-the-art” training models from several providers, Rausch said. That includes Amazon’s own set of Nova models, as well as those created by third parties like Amazon-backed AI startup Anthropic.

The company has faced growing pressure to upgrade Alexa since OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022, wowing users with its ability to perform complex functions like writing fiction and coding software. Suddenly Alexa and other voice assistants like it began to appear outdated, prompting Amazon to consider a revamp.

“They recognize they need to get this right and if they do get it right, then maybe we’re talking less about OpenAI vs. Anthropic and more of Alexa vs. ChatGPT,” said Tom Forte, senior consumer internet analyst at Maxim Group.

CNBC reported last May that Amazon was considering charging a monthly subscription fee for Alexa as part of a push to make money from the service.

An Alexa subscription fee could help Amazon offset the high cost of AI development, and make the digital assistant a more profitable business, said Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager overseeing wearables and other devices at IDC.

“You look at any generative AI system out there, and they all have very high development costs,” Ubrani said.

Amazon will need to tread carefully with a paid Alexa service to avoid alienating Prime subscribers, who already pay $139 a year for the loyalty membership, Ubrani said.

The company will also have to show users “what this new Alexa can do” to justify a subscription, he added. OpenAI offers a free version of ChatGPT, as well as a premium subscription for $20 a month. A paid version of Anthropic’s Claude chatbot costs $20 a month.

“Their audience is already very large, so even transitioning a small portion of those users to a subscription could bring them a fair amount of money,” Ubrani said.

Launched in 2014, Alexa was a passion project of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who envisioned it could one day resemble an all-knowing computer like the one from “Star Trek.” Amazon established an early lead in voice software, and more than 500 million Alexa devices have been sold globally, the company said in 2023.

But Alexa hasn’t been as transformative as Bezos hoped. Most consumers use their digital assistants for “very simple tasks,” like checking the weather or playing music, and primarily via smartphones, not smart speakers, according to Forrester Research.

Alexa also remains unprofitable. Amazon has never charged for access to Alexa, instead infusing it into its lineup of smart speakers, tablets and other devices, which are notoriously priced at or below the cost to make them. The company hoped Alexa interactions would steer consumers toward spending money on its other products and services, but that failed to materialize.

Amazon has lost tens of billions of dollars on its devices business, which includes Echo, Kindle, Fire TV and other products, The Wall Street Journal reported last July.

Following the launch of ChatGPT, Amazon began working to overhaul Alexa with generative AI technology to make it more conversational and useful. The company demoed a souped-up Alexa in 2023, though that new version of Alexa, called “let’s chat,” didn’t launch to the public.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has closely scrutinized, or in some cases discontinued, several of the company’s more unproven or money-losing projects. That included the devices and services unit, which houses Alexa. The unit underwent two rounds of layoffs as part of companywide job cuts in 2022 and 2023, in which more than 27,000 Amazon employees were let go.

Yesterday the store was silent. No chicks. They were all sold out. Apparently lots of people are concerned about egg prices. 

Now, baby chicks usually only cost around $5 each, but when you buy chicks for the first time, there is a ton of equipment you need to get the operation going. You need a heat lamp, dispensers for food/water, pine shavings, brooder (if you don't build your own), medicated chick feed, etc... TSCO sells all of this stuff.  They sell coops at TSCO which can sell for hundreds of dollars. The best part is that they also sell chicken feed so customers who buy chicks today will likely be regular customers for the next 5-7 years. 

The downside is that retail stocks often suffer during a recession, however its possible that farm supply stores could be recession proof if people try to save money by investing in their own property's food producing potential (think victory gardens during WWII), so a national economic downturn could result in more people buying seeds, fertilizer, farm tools, etc...",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iyqqek/this_sounds_odd_but_i_opened_a_long_position_in/,1740585358.0

1iyqfbq,So I took all this risk with SMCI for nothing?,"I'm new to this, and I want to better understand what's happening here. Is this yet another example of sell the news?

I bought SMCI week ago at $55 and was under an impression that 10-k would quickly propell share price to $65+. Days passed and market started to have doubts bottoming at $45 right before market has closed on deadline day and from my perspective I took extra $10 gamble per share.

10k was filed and price quickly shot up to $55+ pre-market which is good news except the fact that market opened below $55 and is still hovering around that price

I could have waited for them to file 10k, avoid all that uneccesary stress and risk and still came up with cheaper shares at the end of it. WTF? Didn't market climb all the way to $65 and then hover around $55-60 leading to 10k? What was the point of that gamble with all the risk and 0 upside?

I get it that market is forward looking but why was it pricing 10k at $55 before filing despite all that risk?

EDIT:

why $65? That's a random number I came up with when making this post and it's based on what stock traded at before 10k was filed. Point is I thought there is upside beyond $55 buy in and I mostly based that conviction on the idea that market makers wouldn't hold shares and risk smci being delisted if there wasn't any premium to make off of it

**NVDA earnings today, will likely decide the fate of the immediate market. It reports at 4:20 ET today!**

News: [China Plans To Start Bank Capital Hike With At Least 55 Billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/china-plans-to-start-bank-capital-hike-with-at-least-55-billion)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)/[**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)/All Semiconductor Stocks/SMH

**Catalyst:** Some catalysts today: Deepseek cuts API pricing by 75%, NVDA is reporting earnings, ChatGPT is doing a limited rollout of ChatGPT 4.5, META considering $200B AI data center.

NVDA reporting earnings is the main catalyst today and decides the immediate direction of the market.

**Technicals:** Mainly interested in seeing if NVDA misses revenue (unlikely) or if they say anything significant due to new export controls which I talked about yesterday (strengthening of CHIPS Act export controls to China).

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** NVDA leads in semis design, is a multi-billion dollar company, etc.

**Risks:** I'm currently positioned defensively (sold calls against my position since I have a decent cost basis from back when DeepSeek news released, so overall will just sit on hands and get out of my position if the earnings are bad).

**Related Tickers:** INTC, QCOM, ASML

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** (Old news) New report shows demand is falling in Europe, with sales dropping a precipitous 45% in January.

**Technicals:** Massive selloff since post-election highs- $300 was a significant level I was watching at the time and we exploded past that, so interested to see if we're able to hold above it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BYD is a major competitor to TSLA and will likely overtake them in the future, and Musk's political actions are seen as controversial in Europe.

**Risks:** Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD, and other auto stocks.

**Ticker:** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**/**[**HOOD (Robinhood)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)**/**[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)**/Other CC Stocks**

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing a selloff mainly due to proposed tariffs and the hack at Bybit, resulting in the loss of \~$1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off has continued, waiting for a larger move still.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Hacks increase fear of storing on centralized exchanges (like Coinbase), proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market volatility. Interestingly enough, ByBit was (theorized) to be hacked by North Korea.

**Related Tickers:** MARA, RIOT

**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/**[**FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)**/Chinese Stocks**

**Catalyst:** China plans to inject at least $55 billion into its largest banks in the coming months as part of a broader stimulus package, Yuan printer go brrrrr. This move is intended to supplement the core Tier 1 capital of China’s six largest state-owned banks. This is the first bank recapitalization since the global financial crisis. 10T yuan (\~$1.4T) debt package to support local government financing and economic stability.

**Technicals:** We've seen a decent upmove on a lot of Chinese stocks due to this, we'll see how the market reacts.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.

**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!

**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU

**Ticker: SMCI**

**Catalyst:** They finally filed an hour before the deadline on the final day! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. 

**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level. We'll see where it goes but worth noting that we've made a significant move back to pre-delisting threat prices already.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.

**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.

# [S&P 500 futures rebound from four-day losing streak, Nvidia gains before earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/25/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Wednesday following a fourth-straight day of losses for the S&P 500. Investors are also awaiting earnings from market bellwether Nvidia.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 93 points, or 0.2%. Nasdaq-100 futures added 0.7%, while S&P 500 futures climbed 0.4%.
*****
> Stocks are coming off a weak session. The S&P 500 tumbled 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost nearly 1.4%. Both indexes logged their fourth consecutive losing day. The 30-stock Dow was the outlier, with a roughly 0.4% advance.
*****
> A weaker-than-expected consumer confidence reading from the Conference Board weighed on stocks Tuesday. A raft of recent reports, including disappointing retail sales numbers and a weak consumer sentiment reading have spurred traders’ worries around the economy over the past week — and the major averages have suffered.
*****
> Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings, due after the closing bell Wednesday, could be the next catalyst for the market. The stock climbed 2% in the premarket Wednesday.
*****
> The report arrives at a pivotal time for Nvidia. The emergence of DeepSeek raised questions about the sustainability of the once-hot artificial intelligence trade. The chip giant and other momentum plays are also showing signs of fizzling, with Nvidia down more than 5% in 2025.
*****
> “I think as the earnings report comes out tomorrow, my expectation is it’s going to be a lot like September,” NYU Stern School of Business finance professor Aswath Damodaran said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “A replay of [the] September [quarter] where they will beat analyst expectations, but the market is going to be disappointed because the market seems to have set expectations higher than what analysts are seeing for the company,” he added.
*****
> Economic data due on Wednesday include new home sales and building permits. The main event for investors will be the release of the personal consumption expenditures price index on Friday. The PCE is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge.

1iyjv2c,Why I Went All-In on Tesla and maybe you should too – The Future is Here,"I know a lot of people are out here chasing ""value stocks"" and ""strong fundamentals,"" but I’ve decided to take a different approach. After hours of deep research (watching a few YouTube videos and scrolling Twitter), I realized something: Tesla isn’t just a car company – it’s a movement.

First, let’s talk about Elon Musk. You might think he’s just a billionaire meme lord, but I see him as the closest thing to a modern-day prophet. Every time he tweets, markets move. That’s power. And if you don’t see the value in that, I don’t know what to tell you.

Second, the balance sheet? Who cares. Numbers are for accountants. Tesla doesn’t operate like a traditional business because it’s not a traditional business. It’s a tech company, an AI powerhouse, a battery innovator, a space exploration partner, and probably the future of teleportation if we’re being honest. Legacy automakers? They're still making cars. Tesla is building the infrastructure for a new civilization.

Then there’s the stock split phenomenon. Every time Tesla splits, it just… goes up. I don’t know why, I don’t need to know why. It just does. Some people say stock splits don’t create value—well, tell that to my brokerage account.

Let’s not forget Full Self-Driving. The haters love to point out that FSD isn’t fully autonomous yet. But real investors understand that it’s about the vision. It doesn’t matter if it’s ready this year, next year, or in 2045. The fact that it’s coming is enough. I don’t need my car to drive itself today—I need the stock to keep going up.

At the end of the day, it’s simple: Tesla is not just a stock. It’s a lifestyle. It’s a mindset. It’s a culture. And if you don’t see that, well, have fun with your little index funds.

See you on Mars. 🚀",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iyjv2c/why_i_went_allin_on_tesla_and_maybe_you_should/,1740562835.0

1iycoxa,Tesla’s market cap sinks below $1 trillion as stock slumps more than 8%,"Tesla’s postelection pop has almost disappeared.

Shares of the electric vehicle maker plunged more than 8% on Tuesday, pushing the company’s market cap below $1 trillion and to its lowest since Nov. 7, which was two days after President Donald Trump’s election victory.

The stock has plummeted 25% to start the year, while the Nasdaq is down just 1.5%, and has slid more than 35% from its record close on Dec. 16. CEO Elon Musk has lost more than $100 billion in net worth over that stretch, though he is still the world’s richest person, with a fortune valued at about $380 billion.

The latest slide followed a report from Reuters on Monday that Tesla’s long-awaited upgrade to its partially automated driving systems left owners disappointed. Many users told the publication that Tesla’s “navigate on city streets” feature in China fell short of Musk’s promises for self-driving technology.

Other EV makers in China, including BYD, offer their partially automated driving systems for free or a much lower cost. Xiaomi’s popular model SU7 includes the company’s equivalent technology as a standard option for free.

The report out of China added to anxiety among Tesla shareholders. Some of the concern has to do with the company’s performance and some is specific to Musk, who is spending much of his time in Washington, D.C., leading President Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Musk, along with his team in Washington, has gained unparalleled access to government computer systems and taxpayer data, and the president has enabled the billionaire to lead mass firings of workers in agencies tasked with oversight of his companies, including Tesla.

Musk’s extremist political rhetoric and activism has led opponents in various markets to organize protests, including at Tesla stores and service centers. Tesla’s stock dropped earlier this month on Trump’s announced plans for extensive tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, which came alongside a decline in Tesla vehicle registrations across Europe in January and February.

For the fourth quarter, Tesla reported earnings and sales that missed analysts’ estimates, with automotive revenue dropping 8% from a year earlier and operating income plummeting 23%. In the late January report, the company cited reduced average selling prices across its aging lineup of Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X vehicles as a major reason for the decline.

According to the California New Car Dealers Association, Tesla sales dropped 11.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024 in the state, which had been Tesla’s biggest market domestically.

Tesla shares are now about 20% above where they were trading prior to Trump’s victory. Most of what remains of the rally is due to the stock’s 15% jump the day after the election. Musk was a major backer of Trump’s presidential effort, contributing $290 million to Republican candidates and causes in 2024, with most of that directed at returning Trump to the White House.

1iybe3w,Retail is running around like headless chickens,"I must have read about 200 posts across various subs in the last 24 hours where retail traders are losing their minds over 3 red days 

Posted on this topic many many times before but many still don't seem to understand the game

Let me put it in layman's terms .... Wall st and big banking control the US stock market heck even the FED are in on it

NOTHING you are investing in fundamentally matters it is ALL A LIE 

They orchestrate the bear and bull markets in their entirety the drive extreme euphoria suck Dumb retail bulls into it and then dump the entire market to scare them into selling whilst shorting that side of the trade and buying back cheap

They've been doing this since the inception of it 

They do the reverse to bears although thats a bit different because they will just pump stocks that have high short interest to fry them and they know bears have shorter time frames to work with 

Robinhood and all the other ""free to trade"" brokers are selling your live trading data to Wall st and other Tutes this is then analysed by A.I and the trading algorithms are then sent to do what they do best 

If retail understood these very simple psychological games and just stopped trying to think they are the next Warren Buffets the markets would be much calmer and most would actually make a profit in the long run 

But that is the only way

Trying to trade against these rigged systems or trying to do a basic "" buy low sell high"" is asking to get fucked 

About 1 in 100,000,000 retail traders will understand this and thats why we will continue seeing chaos and volatility all year 

I'll be sitting on the sidelines with popcorn watching the chaos unfold

1iya4oj,What are stocks that will benefit from the Trump chaos?,"If what Elon and Trump are doing now continues to be bad for the markets, what are specific sectors/countries that will benefit? What's a good buy if I'm very negative on the current direction of the US?

Moving money from the US to foreign markets may be smart, but which? And a crash in the US tends to affect the entire world, so while they'd probably be safer, they won't be safe.

I pulled out of the US markets entirely last week before the 4 down days. I just put 1/3 of my portfolio into EUAD which is an ETF of some of the biggest European defense stocks.  I know I'm a few months late on this one. Europe is realizing that it can't count on the US anymore and will have to grow its own defense industry. I'm definitely willing to investigate and invest in smaller defense stocks too. I don't expect it to go nuts, because these are old established companies and their stocks don't move that fast, but I think it's a very safe bet that Europe's defense stocks are going to grow over the next few years.

What are some other examples of trying to adjust to the current situation? Short TSLA? Invest in other EV companies that take some of the post-TSLA hype? What industries/ETFs represent the best bet for the trade the US loses if it starts implementing tariffs again?

1iy9zjs,Why Rocket Lab Stock Just Crashed,"[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-rocket-lab-stock-just-crashed](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-rocket-lab-stock-just-crashed)

High-flying Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB) stock tumbled down (almost) to Earth Tuesday after Bleecker Street Research -- which publishes ""public short ideas"" for its parent company, stock-shorting firm Bleecker Street Capital -- warned that Rocket Lab's highly anticipated Neutron medium-lift vehicle won't launch for ""a long, long time."" As of 1:15 p.m. ET, Rocket Lab stock is down 9%.

Why Bleecker Street hates Rocket Lab stock

Bleecker Street starts off its short report by naming the catalyst that's primarily responsible for Rocket Lab's 485% surge in stock market value over the last year. It says, ""\[I\]nvestor and analyst excitement over the upcoming launch of Neutron, a medium-lift rocket that RKLB hopes will compete with SpaceX's Falcon 9.""

Rocket Lab has been targeting a mid-2025 first launch for Neutron, with the analysts on [NextSpaceflight.com](http://NextSpaceflight.com) specifically penciling in a July target. But according to Bleecker, Rocket Lab ""has materially misled investors about the likelihood"" that its rocket will fly then.

However, Bleecker argues that Neutron isn't likely to take off before mid-2026 and may not fly before mid-2027. The short-seller supports its accusation by citing conversations with 23 unnamed ""rocket experts"" who have apparently told Bleecker that Rocket Lab's ""engine development,"" ""engine and structure production,"" ""launch pad construction,"" and ""rocket transport to the launch site"" infrastructure are all behind schedule, making a mid-2025 launch impossible.

Further bolstering the short-seller's argument, Bleecker says some of its ""experts"" are actually ""former Rocket Lab engineers and executives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iy9zjs/why_rocket_lab_stock_just_crashed/,1740528263.0

Well the market is likely to tank from everything going on in the US and tariffs from what I can gather

I still will need that 20k

But would rather my portfolio not continually drop and hold roughly its current value

So basically, since you’re all smarter than I am, what fund or assets could I move this money into, from my FXAIX position, that is more stable?

If I didn’t need a sizable chunk of this money in six months I wouldn’t care and would just hold.

But since there’s a serious chance of a recession right now, should I move everything into gold or something?

1iy7k0k,Super Micro surges after filing delayed reports in time with SEC,"Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) surged during post-market hours on Tuesday after the company filed its ""delinquent"" financial reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission just ahead of its deadline.

Shares for the storage, server and networking provider closed the trade day down 11.5% as uncertainty swirled whether it would file its audited annual report for fiscal 2024 and the first two quarters of fiscal 2025 by the February 25 deadline. If not, it faced a possible delisting from Nasdaq.

""Due to EY's (Ernst and Young LLP) stated concerns and subsequent resignation, we were unable to timely file our Annual Report and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2024 (together the 'Delinquent Reports') as required under Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5250,"" the filing reads. ""On December 6, 2024, Nasdaq granted us an exception to Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5250, allowing us to file all the Delinquent Reports by February 25, 2025.""

In Super Micro's 10-K filing, the company contends it does not agree with Ernst and Young's resignation or its reasons for doing so. Concerns about the company's financial statements cropped up in late August, when Hindenburg Research issued a report that it was short Super Micro's shares. A day later, Super Micro said it was delaying its annual 10-K filing.

""The Special Committee did not believe that the resignation of EY or the conclusions reached by EY were supported by the facts examined in the Review, the Special Committee's interim findings reported to EY on October 2, 2024, or the Special Committee's final findings,"" Super Micro reported.

1iy5new,Tesla sales in Europe down 45% in January,"Tesla sales plummeted in Europe in January, suggesting waning demand for the US carmaker’s vehicles after its billionaire chief Elon Musk stepped up his high-profile interventions in the region’s politics.

The EV maker sold just 9,900 units in Europe last month, a decline of more than 45 per cent from the same period in 2024, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Its overall share of new car registrations fell to 1 per cent from 1.8 per cent over the same period.

Tesla’s falling market share comes after Musk’s unprecedented foray into EU politics, where he backed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) ahead of the country’s elections, sparking a backlash on the continent. Musk has also railed against the EU, which he described in November as “undemocratic”.

The fall came even as European consumers purchased 166,000 battery EVs for the month, up 37 per cent from a year ago. Pure EV sales grew faster than those of all other types of vehicles, while sales of cars with petrol and diesel engines fell 20.5 per cent and 26.5 per cent, respectively.

The figures include the EU, UK and other markets including Norway, one of Europe’s biggest markets for EVs.

European sales by SAIC Motor, the Chinese state-backed carmaker that has expanded into the EU and partnered with Audi in China, rose 37 per cent to 23,000 vehicles in January, among the largest year-on-year increases in sales of any large manufacturer in the region.

Overall new vehicle registrations on the continent fell by 2.1 per cent in January to 995,271.

Hey everyone,

I’ve been investing for a few months now and have built a solid foundation with ETFs, which I plan to invest in for the long term. However, since I still have three years of university ahead of me and don’t have a lot of money to invest yet, I want to use this time to experiment and learn more about individual stock investing.

I’m aware of how difficult it is to beat the market, but I also believe that if you don’t even try, you’ll never know. So, I spend time every day watching YouTube videos, analyzing stocks, and reading books. Some of the books I’ve already read include:
	•	One Up on Wall Street – Peter Lynch
	•	The Psychology of Money – Morgan Housel
	•	The Richest Man in Babylon – George S. Clason
	•	And a few lesser-known ones

I have a decent understanding of investing principles, but now I want to go deep into fundamental analysis—learning to properly evaluate every key financial metric: revenue, debt, cash flow, margins, growth rates, etc.

I’m looking for book recommendations that will help me truly master financial statement analysis and develop strong valuation skills. Any suggestions for must-read books on this topic?

Thanks in advance!

1ixzkt2,"No its not the tariffs, the market has been waiting to correct itself for the last two years","Per this yahoo news article (yes I know):

""If 2023 was about being surprised to the upside, there is more risk in 2025 of being surprised to the downside…”

Basically talk of the trump tariffs, or war in ukraine etc etc are all red herrings. The market has honestly been on an unprecedented growth cycle that almost felt disconnected from actual valuations. 

A market slow down in 2025 could be totally warranted. But Ofc people love to blame politics for controlling market cycles when 9/10 this is never the case.

EDIT: dam so people really think the markets follow presidents.... this has been debunked over and over again by economists. Most of the trump tariffs were announced a week ago or more and the markets did not crash like they did today. This sell off is due to a bunch of other factors.

1ixxnao,Genome editing: hype is inevitable,"
One of the most fascinating aspects of genome editing is its ability to potentially enhance not just human health but human capabilities. Take, for example, the controversial experiments in China where scientists edited genes in embryos to make babies resistant to certain diseases and possibly even smarter or fitter. These advancements spark ethical debates, but they also show the immense potential of genome editing to change the course of human evolution. If we can edit genes to fight diseases, enhance physical traits, and even improve intelligence, the possibilities seem endless.

But it’s not just about humans. Genome editing could also revolutionize agriculture. Imagine editing animals to grow more meat.

Looking ahead, the potential applications of genome editing expand even further. If humanity is serious about colonizing Mars, we’ll need people who can withstand the harsh conditions of space and the Red Planet. Genetic editing could play a role in enhancing human abilities to survive in those extreme environments, from boosting resistance to radiation to adapting to lower gravity.
Also super soldiers like Captain America would be used in defence.

Investing in companies like CRSP, NTLA, and BEAM might be one way to tap into this growing sector.

# [Stock futures are flat after S&P 500 posts 3-day losing streak: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were little changed Tuesday after the S&P 500 posted a three-day losing streak, with traders weighing concerns around global trade.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 inched up around 0.1%, while the Nasdaq-100 futures traded near the flatline. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2%.
*****
> Bitcoin prices fell below $90,000 overnight, marking their lowest their lowest level in three months. The blue chip coin is trading almost 20% below its all-time high reached on President Donald Trump’s inauguration day.
*****
> On Monday, shares of key tech companies dragged down the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite to session losses. That decline among tech names also pulled the Nasdaq Composite into negative territory year to date.
*****
> “Investors in the market more broadly, they sort of almost want to believe that the AI trade is over. They’re looking for evidence [and] reasons to doubt,” Doug Clinton, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Monday. “From our perspective, the AI trade is still real. I don’t think this boom is over. I still think we have two to four years to go.”
*****
> Investors are also mulling President Donald Trump’s latest remarks on trade. He said that tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico “will go forward” after the current 30-day moratorium ends.
*****
> Wall Street also turned its attention to key earnings reports. Home Depot reported fourth-quarter figures that beat analyst expectations, but the stock shed about 2% in the premarket.
*****
> Nvidia is set to report earnings Wednesday after the bell.
*****
> On the economic front, investors are turning their attention to the latest U.S. consumer confidence data due out at 10 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index to show a reading of 102.3 for February, less than the previous month’s reading of 104.1.
*****
> The report comes ahead of a slew of other economic data releases later in the week, including January’s personal consumption expenditures price index reading Friday. The PCE is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge.

1ixvyru,These are the stocks on my watchlist (02/25),"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

I'm back. Crazy how I miss a few days and that's when everything is going nuts lol.

News: [Trump Administration Seeks More Restrictions On China Tech Weighs Nvidia Curbs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/trump-administration-seeks-more-restrictions-on-china-tech-weighs-nvidia-curbs)

**Ticker:** [**SMH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)**,** [**NVDA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)**,** [**AMD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is planning to strengthen semiconductor export controls to China, aiming to strengthen the CHIPS act from Biden's term.

Additionally, DeepSeek is accelerating the release of its new AI model, R2, following the success of its R1 model. (Most of their training is done on NVDA chips)

**Technicals:** Mainly interested to see if we can hold above $130 for NVDA- note that earnings are tomorrow so the short-term performance of the stock hinges on that. Currently long and sold 155C to hedge my position against it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen the CHIPS act actually affect the way that semiconductor companies sell to China- most of those restrictions are bypassed, so this strengthening of export controls might actually affect the industry.

**Risks:** More export controls may lead to China giving tariffs in retaliation- but again, most semis are supply constrained rather than demand constrained so I don't see it as a significant catalyst until more details are released.

**Related Tickers:** [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d), [QCOM](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QCOM&p=d), [ASML](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASML&p=d)

**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**,** [**FXI (FTSE China 50 Index)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)

**Catalyst:** BABA has introduced its own AI reasoning model within the Qwen framework (like how META has the Llama framework), while we have a surge of all Chinese stock performance following the Chinese government's announcement of liquidity measures.

**Technicals:** It seems as if we've peaked (BABA has gone up close to 50% since the start of this month) for most Chinese stocks in the past few days, I would be interested in being short but I was on vacation this weekend. Interested in shorting BABA specifically if we make another large up move like we did on 2/20.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BABA is one of the major competitors that is working on AI models, and is notably using NVDA cards to train its models. 

**Risks:** Mainly tariff news and news from other rivals with better models. Straightforward.

**Related Tickers:** [JD](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d), [BIDU](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BIDU&p=d)

**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Previously, PLTR faced concerns due to defense budget cuts and CEO Alex Karp reducing his stake in the company. We've seen it make a massive run from retail and fall just as quickly.

**Technicals:** Interested in playing a small bounce- we're up \~10% since last earnings report (and pre-crazy move), there is potential for a small bounce here but only entering a small position since it looks like we bottomed early premarket today. 

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Trump directed the government to make significant cuts to the defense budget. (This is a far more significant catalyst than Alex Karp selling shares)

**Risks:** PLTR lives and dies on defense contract money, so obviously further cuts/expansions will affect stock price.

**Related Tickers:** [BA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&p=d), [GD](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GD&p=d), [RTX](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RTX&p=d)

**Ticker:** [**COIN**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**,** [**HOOD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)**,** [**MSTR**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing heightened volatility due to proposed tariffs and a significant security breach at Bybit, resulting in the loss of approximately $1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off resulting in the biggest Coin going to $90K has me watching the stock related proxies that deal with the market. 

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** CC platforms are highly susceptible to regulatory changes and security incidents.

Proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market vol, while large-scale hacks undermine investor trust and lead to sell-offs in the market as it spreads fear and people wanting to cash out.

**Risks:** Regulatory interventions impose additional compliance costs and operational constraints on CC exchanges.

Security breaches not only result in financial losses but also lead to decreased user adoption and revenue.

Now, with bird flu gaining traction in the headlines, we might be witnessing the next wave of pandemic fears building up again.

Here’s what I’m seeing:
Bird Flu Panic is Starting to Build.
Governments and media outlets are sounding the alarm on H5N1 bird flu, which has recently started spreading. This is leading to speculation that it could be the next global health crisis. The fears that people had about COVID-19 in early 2020 are resurfacing, and it seems like the panic might be building again—just like it did with the rise of COVID. If the situation escalates, the market could see a huge surge in stocks related to pandemic preparedness.

Stocks to Watch: Moderna & Arcturus
Moderna is already making waves with its mRNA technology. They’ve received massive funding to develop vaccines for H5N1, and just like with COVID, their stock could explode if bird flu turns into a global health emergency.
Arcturus Therapeutics is still early in their trials for an mRNA-based bird flu vaccine (H5N1). While they’re in Phase 1, the stock could skyrocket if the pandemic narrative continues to push forward and they get positive trial data. This is one of those high-risk, high-reward opportunities.

Pfizer’s at the Bottom Right Now.
Pfizer has been struggling recently and is at a low point in its stock price. While they were a leader in COVID vaccines, it seems like they’ve taken a hit with diminishing COVID vaccine demand now that the pandemic phase is over. This might be a buy the dip opportunity if bird flu takes off, but right now, they’re lagging behind the Moderna in bird flu vaccines developing

The market always seems to react in waves, and this could be a “buy the dip” scenario like we saw with COVID vaccine stocks in 2020. Moderna and Arcturus are looking like the stocks to watch closely. If the bird flu narrative keeps building momentum, don’t be surprised if these stocks see massive moves similar to what we saw in early 2020.

At the end of the day, whether you believe the hype or not, the market is reactionary, and if the bird flu narrative gets stronger, we could see some wild price swings.

Let me know what you think! Are you ready for another pandemic panic, or is this just another false alarm?

1ixt56v,On Market Timing,"You cannot time the market, but there are times when it is due for a crash. At those times you definitely don’t want to buy on the dips, and you want to sell a bit more on the rips. Major market declines can happen really fast (think of the flash crash), but major declines like 2000 and 2008 give you notice that they’re coming. **Crashes occur when a majority of investors are just wrong about something big.** If you want to make money on stocks over the long run, it’s good to see the crashes coming. I’m pretty sure that one is coming now. I'm a successful investor with 30 years in equities. Let me review my experience in the dot com crash and the 2008 financial crisis.

I started investing significantly in 1996, when I got a better paying job. It was fun. You could identify new technologies and hold on for meteoric rise. I made a lot on IOM and AFFX. But it was clear that the market did not actually understand the internet. A company could double its market capitalization by getting a web site and renaming itself a dot com. Valuations reflected the mistaken idea that doing exactly the same business online was somehow going to be much more profitable. I remember realizing that I owned stocks that were worth far more than the underlying value of the company, but kept going up. I developed a rule (sell a third every time it triples) to get my money back while continuing to profit from the insanity. When things started to turn south, it didn’t take a genius to get out. When the bleeding stopped, I was early to get back in, looking for stocks that found support (low volume on down days) during the crash. Among the stocks I bought in 2001, I’ve done the best with AAPL.

The other big bear market I went through was 2008. Again, the fall can be traced to something that the majority of investors had wrong. I remember talking to a mortgage broker in 2004. They were pushing balloon mortgages and other nonsense that allowed people to buy houses they could not afford. I asked about the terms, and realized that shit would hit the fan in 2007 or 2008. It was not hard to see. There were a lot of these mortgages. As a homeowner, I got cold calls inviting me to refinance my 30 year fixed with something that would have a lower rate for a few years before exploding. Again, the economy was headed in the wrong direction because the market somehow thought these were safe. I can’t claim to have seen the crash coming (I thought the damage would be limited to foolish homeowners), but leveraged collateralized mortgage obligations set financial markets up for a fall. My point is that, once again, the market fell because the market was just wrong about something, and eventually reality could no longer be ignored.

We’re here again. A lot of people think Trump/DOGE will be good for business. Taxes will be cut and government waste eliminated. They do not understand how the parts of government being eliminated are good for business. I’ll give you three examples. First, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been eliminated, or at least crippled. The idea is that less regulation is a good thing. But without that protection, more consumers are going to be subject to scams, and the more sophisticated are not going to use services like X Money at all, because they are no longer safe. Second, there have been huge cuts to funding for science (NIH, USDA, NSF, etc.) with almost no attempt to identify what spending is actually wasteful. Innovation comes from science, so this will be very very bad for business over the long run. Third, DOGE cancelled legal contracts for government services with no warning. Even if you think that providing services to refugees is wasteful, it’s not fraudulent, and the American businesses who had those contracts were obviously hurt, as was trust in the government. 

Is it too late to avoid disaster? Maybe not, but I don’t see Donald Trump saying “oops” anytime soon.

So, we’re there again. The market will fall because the market is wrong about something big.  
You can’t time the market, but this is not the time to buy on the dips, and I’ve been selling.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ixt56v/on_market_timing/,1740484088.0
1ixs5aj,The Hidden Story of QuantumScape and Volkswagen: A Speculative Analysis from 2022 to 2025 and Beyond,"QuantumScape occupies a unique position as the only publicly traded solid-state battery EV technology company, requiring it to disclose far more information than its private competitors such as Factorial, ProLogium, and SES. While this visibility makes it a valuable source of information for investors, it has also become a strategic tool. The company has developed a pattern of delaying public confirmations of progress, often by one or two quarters, allowing it to control the narrative around its development.

Initially, this seemed to be a response to the investor lawsuits in 2022, which accused QuantumScape of misleading commercialisation timelines. By adopting a “prove first, announce later” approach, it reduced legal risks while keeping investors engaged. However, this delay serves another function: keeping competitors uncertain about its true progress.

Unlike private companies, which can operate in relative secrecy, QuantumScape must disclose financials, technology milestones, and partnerships through earnings calls, shareholder letters, and regulatory filings. This leaves it in a vulnerable position where competitors must rely on these disclosures to estimate its progress. By delaying key confirmations, QuantumScape ensures that its actual development is always ahead of what competitors perceive.

# How the Transcript-to-Letter Analysis Reveals QuantumScape’s Strategy

Over time, a clear pattern has emerged in the way QuantumScape discloses information. By comparing earnings call transcripts with future shareholder letters, it becomes possible to identify developments that were hinted at before being formally confirmed in later filings. This approach provides insight into how the company downplays milestones until they are fully validated, creating a built-in delay between when an event actually happens and when the market is informed.

The process works as follows:

1. **Identifying Forward-Looking Statements in Transcripts:**
   * During earnings calls, QuantumScape often mentions ongoing projects, goals for the coming year, and broad strategic plans. These statements are carefully worded to avoid firm commitments.
   * Phrases such as “we are making good progress,” “we are targeting,” or “we expect to begin validation” indicate that a milestone may have already been reached but has not yet been confirmed.
2. **Matching Statements to Later Shareholder Letters:**
   * Shareholder letters, published one or two quarters later, often contain more specific confirmations of previous statements.
   * If an earnings call in Q2 discusses a target and the shareholder letter in Q4 confirms that the milestone was achieved, it suggests that QuantumScape had likely reached that point well before announcing it.
3. **Recognising the Pattern of Delayed Confirmations:**
   * This approach has been observed multiple times, particularly in relation to prototype shipments, separator technology development, and PowerCo’s involvement.
   * For example, A0 samples were already validated internally in 2023, yet this was only publicly confirmed in early 2024.

This method of tracking delayed confirmations allows investors to anticipate upcoming announcements based on what has already been hinted at in earlier transcripts. It also reveals how far along QuantumScape actually is compared to its public disclosures.

# A Pattern of Delayed Confirmations and Hidden Progress: 2022 to 2025

# 2022: Lawsuits and the Beginning of Controlled Messaging

QuantumScape began 2022 with strong momentum but soon found itself facing lawsuits alleging that it had overstated its commercialisation timeline. This prompted a fundamental shift in communication, ensuring that no milestone would be announced until it was fully validated.

This meant that throughout 2022, earnings calls became more vague, with fewer forward-looking statements and a greater emphasis on measured language. Instead of predicting when milestones would be reached, QuantumScape began speaking in terms of progress without firm commitments.

# 2023: The Silent Acceleration Phase

By 2023, the company was progressing behind the scenes. It had already shipped A0 prototype samples to PowerCo, begun work on B0 samples, and expanded production capabilities, yet it continued to downplay its progress.

By comparing transcripts from early 2023 to shareholder letters in 2024, it becomes clear that A0 samples were internally validated in 2023 but only confirmed publicly in early 2024. This suggests that any major development QuantumScape hints at today is likely already further along than stated.

Meanwhile, Volkswagen was adjusting its broader EV strategy. Despite reducing its commitments in other areas, it continued investing in QuantumScape, indicating that it saw solid-state technology as an essential component of its long-term plans.

# 2024: PowerCo’s Deal and Volkswagen’s EV Strategy Shift

By mid-2024, PowerCo announced a non-exclusive licensing agreement with QuantumScape, committing significant funding to commercialise the company’s batteries. Given the pattern of delayed confirmations, it is reasonable to assume that this deal had already been finalised several months earlier and that PowerCo engineers were embedded within QuantumScape’s operations before the public confirmation.

Volkswagen’s decision to continue working with QuantumScape, despite scaling back some of its other battery investments, suggests that it sees QuantumScape’s technology as fundamental to its strategy.

# What May Already Be Happening but Has Not Yet Been Announced

Given QuantumScape’s habit of delaying public confirmations, it is possible to infer developments that are already in progress but have yet to be disclosed.

* **Cobra separator manufacturing equipment is likely already installed at PowerCo’s facilities.**
   * QuantumScape referenced next-generation separator equipment early in 2024 but only confirmed Cobra’s operational status in the fourth quarter. If this follows the company’s usual pattern, orders for Cobra may have been placed much earlier, and PowerCo may already be integrating it into its manufacturing process.
* **B1 sample production is likely already functional.**
   * QuantumScape listed B1 samples as a 2025 goal, but given that A0 and B0 were also downplayed before being confirmed, B1 samples are likely already working and undergoing internal testing at PowerCo.
* **At least one new OEM deal is probably already signed.**
   * In early 2025, QuantumScape said it was negotiating with two OEMs. Given its history of only announcing partnerships once deals are finalised, at least one of these agreements is likely already in place but undisclosed.
* **Mass production may begin in 2026 rather than 2027-2028.**
   * QuantumScape has been cautious about stating when production will begin, but if PowerCo is already integrating Cobra, the actual timeline may be earlier than publicly stated.

# The Market is Large, but First-Mover Advantage Matters

The solid-state battery industry is projected to exceed $1 trillion by 2035, covering EVs, grid storage, consumer electronics, and eVTOLs. There will be multiple successful players, and automakers are likely to work with several battery suppliers rather than relying on a single provider.

However, being the first to mass-produce solid-state batteries at scale is critically important. Unlike other technologies, automakers do not easily switch battery platforms due to the complexities of integration. Once a company establishes itself as a reliable supplier, it becomes difficult to displace.

QuantumScape does not need to eliminate competition. It only needs to be first to mass production, which would allow it to lock in early supply contracts, set industry standards, and establish itself as the reference technology for next-generation EVs.

By delaying confirmations, QuantumScape ensures that competitors remain behind, automakers feel pressured to commit early, and its manufacturing knowledge is protected. This is not simply a legal safeguard but a deliberate strategy to secure long-term leadership in a technology that has the potential to reshape the EV industry.

The real question is not what QuantumScape is saying today—it is what the company has already achieved that will not be disclosed until the next quarter.  Revenue is now within touching distance, and so is massive stock appreciation.

1ixpdzw,SMCI should have a stellar few days.,"SMCI, one of several AI stocks I invested in and recommended in early 2023, saw over tenfold gains before crashing due to overly optimistic projections and accounting concerns, leading to delayed SEC filings and the resignation of its auditors.

Now, SMCI faces a crucial deadline—it must submit its overdue 10-K and 10-Q filings by Feb 25 to avoid potential delisting. If they file on time, the stock will surge significantly, but short sellers are pushing a bearish narrative, betting on a missed deadline and Nasdaq removal. 

However, a lack of insider selling and institutional shorting suggests confidence in an on-time filing, making the current price potentially undervalued. If you already have a brokerage account and risk capital, SMCI may present a speculative opportunity ahead of the filing. That said, this can be seen as a high-risk, short-term bet, not a typical long-term investment. However, longer-term, SMCI remains a strong AI player, uniquely positioned to benefit from demand for custom-built AI servers, especially for Nvidia’s chips, while competitors like Dell and Lenovo lag behind. 



High Confidence for a Timely 10-K...

🚀 SMCI 10-K FILING: LESS THAN 24 HOURS TO GO 🚀

The probability of an on-time 10-K filing (Feb 25, 2025) is estimated at over 90% based on available data.


---

🔹 NO NOTICE OF LATE FILING

SMCI has historically provided 1-3 days’ notice when they were unable to file on time.

No notice has been given yet about a delay for the Feb 25, 2025, deadline, strongly suggesting they are on track.

📌 Key Insight: If SMCI were going to miss tomorrow’s deadline, we likely would have already heard by now.

🟢 BOTTOM LINE: No delay notice = strong confidence in an on-time filing.


---

🔹 KEY REASONS FOR CONFIDENCE

✅ INSTITUTIONAL CONFIDENCE

Large investors reviewed SMCI’s financials for the recent $700M convertible note offering.

Institutions require transparency before committing capital, indicating the 10-K is largely complete.


✅ NO MAJOR ACCOUNTING ISSUES

The latest 8-K filing flagged no major financial discrepancies, reducing concerns about serious accounting restatements.


✅ HISTORICAL PRECEDENT

Most companies in similar situations file on time to maintain credibility with investors and regulators.


✅ MORGAN STANLEY’S STRUCTURED INVESTMENT

Morgan Stanley issued market-linked securities (MLS) tied to SMCI’s stock, meaning institutional capital is betting on its future performance.

These securities offer contingent coupon payments of 31.25% annually, reinforcing that major financial institutions see upside potential in SMCI.



---

🔹 IMPACT OF THE MORGAN STANLEY STRUCTURED INVESTMENT

📌 What does this mean for SMCI investors?

Reinforces institutional confidence in SMCI.

Could influence price action, especially if short sellers try to manipulate volatility.

Signals that major financial players see an opportunity in SMCI despite recent concerns.



---

🔹 WHAT TO EXPECT TOMORROW

⏳ TIMING:

The 10-K will likely be filed after-hours, around 4:30–5:00 PM EST.


📉 PRICE ACTION:

If the stock dips intraday, it may be due to weak hands selling in fear.

Once the filing is confirmed, upside potential is high.

Morgan Stanley’s structured investment may exacerbate volatility as institutions hedge their positions, amplifying swings both up and down.


📈 LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:

SMCI remains fundamentally strong.

Once the uncertainty of the delayed 10-K is removed, the stock has room to climb significantly.



---

🔹 MINOR RISKS TO CONSIDER

⚠️ REGULATORY SCRUTINY

The SEC & DOJ investigations (linked to Hindenburg allegations) exist.

However, no fraud or major restatements have been indicated.


⚠️ MARKET VOLATILITY

Stock price fluctuations may continue, but they do not affect the likelihood of the filing itself.



---

🔹 FINAL THOUGHT

We are very close to the finish line.

If SMCI delivers on time, expect:
✅ Relief buying
✅ Short covering
✅ Strong momentum

If the stock drops further before the filing, it may present a buying opportunity for those with conviction.

Stay focused—tomorrow could be a major turning point. 🚀

1ixej1r,"Starbucks to lay off 1,100 corporate workers as sales sag","Starbucks will lay off 1,100 corporate employees and will not fill several hundred other open positions, the coffee chain’s CEO, Brian Niccol, said Monday.

The cuts will not affect workers at the company’s cafes.

In a message to corporate employees, Niccol said Starbucks is “simplifying our structure, removing layers and duplication and creating smaller, more nimble teams.”

“Our intent is to operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration,” Niccol wrote. “All with the goal of being more focused and able to drive greater impact on our priorities.” 

The layoffs come as Starbucks tries to draw coffee drinkers back to its cafes after same-store sales declined for four straight quarters. As customers turn to cheaper rivals in Starbucks’ two largest markets, the U.S. and China, Niccol has tried to revamp operations since he took the helm of the company last year, including by speeding up service.

Starbucks had about 16,000 employees who work outside of store locations as of last year. The cuts will affect people who work in corporate support, but not roasting, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution.

1ixeabc,Hims & Hers shares tumble 18% as margin miss adds to concerns about GLP-1 business,"Hims & Hers Health shares plunged 18% in extended trading on Monday after investors looked past better-than-expected revenue and earnings and focused instead on the disappointing gross margin.

Here’s how the company did:

* **Earnings per share:** 11 cents vs. 10 cents expected by LSEG
* **Revenue:** $481 million vs. $470 million expected by LSEG

Revenue at the telehealth company increased 95% in the fourth quarter from $246.6 million during the same period last year, according to a release.

However, the company’s gross margin, or the profit left after accounting for the cost of goods sold, was 77%, while analysts polled by StreetAccount were expecting 78.4%.

It’s the second big stock drop for Hims & Hers in a matter of days. The shares tumbled 26% on Friday after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that the shortage of semaglutide injection products has been resolved.

In May, Hims & Hers started prescribing compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster GLP-1 medications Ozempic and Wegovy. The company was a breakout star within the digital health sector in 2024, in part because of the success of its popular new weight loss offering. The stock climbed about 200% for the year.

Compounded drugs are custom-made alternatives to brand-name drugs designed to meet a specific patient’s needs, and compounders are allowed to produce them when brand-name treatments are in shortage. The FDA said Friday that it will start taking action against compounders for violations in the next 60 to 90 days.

Hims & Hers also offers treatments for skin care, mental health, sexual health and hair care.

Excluding its GLP-1 offerings, revenue increased 43% to $1.2 billion for the full year, “meeting our previous 2025 revenue target a year early,” CFO Yemi Okupe said in a release.

“The success we are experiencing is a direct reflection of our improving ability to democratize access to high quality, personalized care across each of our specialties,” Okupe said.

Net income climbed to $26.01 million, or 11 cents per share, from $1.25 million, or 1 cent per share, a year prior. The company reported adjusted earnings of $54.1 million, meeting analyst estimates, according to StreetAccount.

For the first quarter, Hims & Hers expects to report revenue of $520 million to $540 million, while analysts were expecting $497 million. Adjusted earnings will be between $55 million to $65 million for the period, the company said.

1ixcnn1,SHALL WE PLAY A GAME? (I love the 80s..and we are headed back!),"When I say that phrase I hear it in the movie computer voice.  Anyway, I vaguely remember the stock market crash of 1987.  I was young but I used to play a stock trading game on my “IBM Compatible” computer which really wasn’t but that is how they sold you computers back then.  It had a ticker that would scroll across the screen and you could buy and sell stocks in made up companies.

No one really knows where the stock market is heading the rest of the year but I could make a pretty good argument we are moving towards stagflation temporarily.  I can see a scenario of a weakening economy with persistent inflation.  So, if the market were to move negative the rest of the year, what are your picks to see the largest downside moves?

My picks:

TSLA - Obvious reasons…its stock prices is built on a dream that is becoming a nightmare
PINS - Low revenue growth outside the U.S, ADU growth slowing down, It is mostly ads now and almost unusable. 25B market came to 3.5B revenue.
SNAP - 11 years in and still can’t make a profit.  

Also, if federal grant money really does decline, and cuts to Medicaid, pick any public health care stock and buy puts.  If they cancel infrastructure contracts, pick most of the shovel companies like Caterpillar and buy puts.  If they cancel the farmer subsidies, buy puts in John Deere.  So many others that are going to be hurt.

So what is your pick for the largest declining stock of 2025 between 2/25 and 12/31?  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ixcnn1/shall_we_play_a_game_i_love_the_80sand_we_are/,1740430348.0

1ix6nix,Congress Buying Applied Materials Stock,"Is there anyone with due diligence or an in-depth understanding of Applied Materials who could weigh in? Specifically related to US Export controls impacting Applied Materials re:China. Keep in mind, I'm hearing increased rhetoric lately on Trump having a surprisingly pro-China agenda (could be wrong - LMK if so).

**Idea Genesis**: US Senator, Ashley Moody bought $300-$750k in Applied Materials ($AMAT) stock. Though I know she was only recently appointed in Jan 2025. She sits on these following relevant committees: 

(less interestingly) **Senate Committee on the Judiciary**: oversees the Department of Justice, considers judicial nominations, and reviews legislation related to civil liberties, **intellectual property**, and antitrust law.

(more interestingly) **Joint Economic Committee (JEC)**: reviewing economic conditions and recommending improvements in economic policy. It studies the implications of the Economic Report of the President and coordinates programs involved in the report.

Committees like the JEC, plays a vital role in setting the legislative framework for **export controls.** They can:

1. 1. Pass laws that authorize and guide export control policies. 
2. Conduct oversight of the executive branch's implementation of these policies. 
3. Examine the economic impact of export controls.  

The JEC specifically focuses on analyzing economic conditions and recommending economic policies. So, they would be involved in analyzing the economic effects of export bans, such as:

**Takeaway1:** Any thoughts on the US changing export control bans to China? Impacting companies like Applied Materials?

**Takeaway2:** Any other notable points regarding Applied Materials on go forward tailwinds/headwinds?

Their fundamentals look rosy given the current share price ($172; -32% vs. July 2024 peak).

1ix27vd,"Microsoft Cancels Some Data Center Leases, TD Cowen Says. What It Means for the AI Trade.","Microsoft has begun to scale back on data center spending, according to an analysts’ note, but Wall Street is divided on whether this suggests a change to the company’s artificial-intelligence strategy.

TD Cowen analysts first reported in a research note Friday that Microsoft had cancelled leases with “at least two data private center operators” in the U.S., amounting to a few hundred megawatts.

Shares of Microsoft were flat in premarket trading Monday.

The analysts said the tech behemoth also has pulled back on the conversion of statements of qualification to leases and had re-allocated a considerable portion of its international spending to the U.S., pointing to a potential oversupply.

However, Jefferies analysts said in a note Monday that Microsoft executives were “strongly refuting” any change to their data center strategy.

The company is “always tweaking their forecasting of how tight certain regions will be and where investment needs to be prioritized,” the analysts continued.

They noted that the company had guided to capital expenditure growth slowing year over year, “so down from the 50% to 60% YoY pace, but still growing.”

It is “still too early” to say if the changes in data center capacity are a reflection of softer-than-expected AI demand or oversupply, the analysts wrote. In their view, the changes could be driven by power constraints or better-than-expected data-center efficiency.

“Zooming out, reminder that we are still very much in the early innings of this AI buildout, and not everything will be linear or in a straight line,” the analysts continued. “What is increasingly clear is that the market’s faith in the whole AI capex narrative is wobbling.”

The response here kind of proves the point.  Bulls here have always had the DCA mindset, which is all good,  but if you're not hedged for big corrections don't pretend like you're a genius investor. How many of you are simply sitting on mag7 below current cost and riding on that hope?

I'd like to note, it's alarming how many of you think insane tarrifs will not have an affect on the market, it shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the current supply chain. 

The fact consumer sentiment is down 10% isn't insignificant. 

2% corrections across the broader markets are not nothing.

NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely and take care of those who get the ""short straws in life.""

Buffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump.

The 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3.

He nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has ""vividly shown his ability"" to deploy capital.

""It won't be long"" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.

Buffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.

Quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.

Net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab and American Express (AXP.N), opens new tab.

Berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.

""Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,"" Buffett wrote.

'FISCAL FOLLY'

This year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.

""Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,"" Buffett said.

Buffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.

He said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,
But he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism ""has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,"" with malfeasance by ""scoundrels and promoters"" in full force.

He urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying ""fiscal folly"" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times ""come close to the edge.""

Buffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the ""American miracle,"" has depended on people's ability to participate.

That, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.

""Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,"" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.
""And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,"" he added.

Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire ""hold,"" said: ""Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.""

FEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES

While Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.

Other stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.

Berkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.
The company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.

Over the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.

""They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

At Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.

Tens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.

Buffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been ""eliminated or greatly minimized.""

The meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.

1iwf110,Don’t sleep on Pinterest (PINS),"Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) has been flexing some solid numbers lately. In Q4 2024, they hit a milestone with revenue topping $1.15 billion, an 18% jump year-over-year, making it their first billion-dollar quarter. For the full year, they racked up $3.65 billion in revenue, up 19% from 2023. Their user base is growing too—global monthly active users (MAUs) reached an all-time high of 553 million, up 11% from last year. On the profit front, Q3 2024 showed a GAAP net income of $31 million, with an adjusted EBITDA of $242 million, proving they’re not just growing but also sharpening their focus on profitability. Total costs and expenses for Q3 were $904 million, showing they’re keeping things in check while scaling.

Pinterest stands out as a unique social media platform with a focus on inspiration and discovery, driving high-intent users—think DIY enthusiasts, shoppers, and planners—straight to actionable ideas. Its revenue has been climbing steadily,fuelled by smart ad innovations like shoppable pins and a growing user base of over 500 million monthly active users. Unlike fleeting platforms, Pinterest users stick around, curating boards with long-term value, which keeps engagement sticky and ad potential strong. Plus, it’s carving a niche in e-commerce, partnering with brands to tap into a $2 trillion addressable market. With its stock still seen as undervalued by some analysts and a clear path to profitability, Pinterest could be a sleeper hit for patient investors.

1iweku5,Nvidia Suppliers Send Mixed Signals for Delays on GB200 Systems – What It Means for NVDA Stock,"Recently Analyst Beth Kindig, a bullish analyst, put out an interesting newsletter that was surprisingly bearish on Nvidia due to their supplier commentary. Earnings on Wednesday should be very interesting. Here’s a consolidated copy

Super Micro Lowers FY25 Revenue Guide, Pushes Back 30% Liquid Cooling Target


Super Micro recently reported preliminary fiscal Q2 results, in which it cut its fiscal 2025 revenue guide while hinting that Blackwell GPUs could take longer to ramp in the first part of the calendar year.

At Computex in June 2024, CEO Charles Liang stated that he “expects 15 percent of racks [SMCI] sells this year to use DLC, and 30 percent to employ it [in 2025].” In August 2024,  Liang slightly changed his tune, noting that they now expect “25% to 30% of the new global datacenter deployments to use DLC solutions in the next 12 months.”

I remember this comment well, as it was part of the evidence used to debunk the August rumors considering SMCI had moved up their timeline for DLC delivery (from end of year 2025 to mid-year 2025).

Two weeks ago in the February 2025 report, this timeline was shifted back with Liang stating that Super Micro now believes that “DLC or overall liquid cooling market share will grow all the way to 30% or even more in the next 12 months” -- it’s not a dramatic shift in tone but rather pushes the 30% target back from mid-year 2025 noted in August, to beyond the original year-end timeline --- to now technically being early 2026.

The August earnings call also housed one critical piece of information regarding Blackwell and Super Micro’s 2025 revenue. Wells Fargo’s Aaron Rakers questioned management about Blackwell and guidance for December 2024 and onwards. Liang explained that for the December quarter, Blackwell “will be very small. Engineering sample small volume. So the real volume, I believe, had to be March quarter next year. And that's why we foresee only $26 billion to $30 billion.”

But now, SMCI implied they are not able to ship Blackwell in the March quarter:

Super Micro has walked back the revenue guide that hinged on Blackwell’s NVL systems shipping in volume in the March quarter. Management was also quite clear that the new product was facing a delay as they await more GPU supply.

Vertiv Signals Softer Q1


Vertiv is a provider of thermal and power management solutions and is a leader in direct liquid cooling. The company stated they benefited from a “particularly strong” Q4, with revenue rising nearly 26% YoY as they overdelivered by nearly $200 million as customers wanted products as soon as possible.

Vertiv’s strength in Q4 may be tied to key partner Dell, as its AI server backlog in fiscal Q3 (October quarter) rose more than 18% QoQ to $4.5 billion after being flat QoQ in Q2, and its AI pipeline rising more than 50% QoQ. Analysts placed Dell’s AI server pipeline at $16 to $17 billion, up from $11 to $13 billion previously, a rather large jump for one quarter. However, Dell noted that one factor for its softer Q4 and fiscal year guide was the “unpredictability of the AI shipments” as there are “some more timing differences than what we were anticipating when we gave the guide the last quarter.”

For Q1, Vertiv guided a deceleration to 19% YoY growth, with FY25 revenue growth guided at 16%. Management defended this deceleration into Q1 by saying: “Now of course, Q4 was particularly strong. So we should not look at Q1 as a quarter-to-quarter, really look at the first quarter sales as the acceleration that has taken place. With a 19% organic growth in the first quarter, I feel very, very good about what that tells us about our overall trajectory” and also that it is “higher than what we actually saw in 2024.”

Liquid cooling capacity is not a constraint for Vertiv, as they had said last summer that they were “on track to finish in 2024 with a 45x capacity increase compared to baseline at the end of 2023.”

I agree with the analyst sentiment (and weak price action) following the report that the commentary doesn’t check out exactly. management is contradicting itself by guiding for organic growth of 19% at the midpoint for Q1 but 16% growth for the fiscal year (i.e., slower growth later in the year) while stating shipments will increase QoQ.

Additionally, the QoQ/YoY has to be looked at which is lower than what typical seasonality would account for, as our numbers indicate Vertiv was down (12.1%) due to seasonal sequential growth from Q4-Q1. This year, Vertiv is down (16.9%) from Q4-Q1.

My conclusion (still to be confirmed) is that Vertiv may see a weak Q2 before there is an acceleration into the back half.


Networking Companies Shift Tone on Timing for GB200s


PCIe 6.0 supplier:

PCIe 6.0 is a networking standard expected to initially ship with Nvidia’s Blackwell. A key supplier stated to expect this in the second half of the year, as these products “are driving higher dollar content opportunities [...] on a full rack and full accelerator basis and we expect volume deployments to begin in the second half of this year.”

Revealed at GTC in March of 2024, PCIe 6.0 was initially expected to launch with the GB200s. The following quote from this supplier also hints that merchant GPUs (Nvidia) will not be driving H1 – which would be odd if Blackwell was shipping. “Now, if you look into 2025, we see both contributing growth. The first half of the year will be more predominantly the internal AI accelerator programs. But if you get into the back half of the year, the transition on the merchant GPUs will also be very strong for us. This is where you'll see the custom rack configurations start to deploy and that’s where we see a big dollar increase in our contemporary GPU with [our product] starting to ramp.”

PMIC Suppliers:

PMICs (power management integrated circuits) are a critical part of the picture for Blackwell, given that these components were linked to Blackwell’s rumored power management issues. Major PMIC suppliers were unable to confirm volume shipments in the first quarter in recent earnings calls.

One PMIC supplier that we covered on our Advanced site on Feb 5th, is stating that “We know that we're not the only one players going after this, so the share is still to be determined. The final design, everything is still to be finalized as well, too. So we're working closely with the customer. Again, at this point, we can say that we're targeting for a mid-year launch.”

This company is either discussing Blackwell Ultra with the B300s, or they are implying GB200s are delayed.

The competing PMIC supplier stated: “Just to add a little bit of color to how we see the year rolling out, we believe that we will be off to a slower start in the first half of the year. But as the year develops, the customer base is expected to broaden as hyperscalers launch their new products. We have multiple product ramps with both existing customers as well as with these new hyperscalers.”

The takeaway is that neither PMIC supplier can confirm they are shipping in volume in Q1 or Q2, yet meanwhile, both are saying they are still part of the supply chain.

Semtech Suddenly Pulls Guidance on Active Copper Cabling (ACCs)


Perhaps the most drastic commentary to come out of the last few weeks was when a key supplier pulled its Q1 guidance intra-quarter.

Semtech filed an 8-K stating that “net sales from its CopperEdge products used in active copper cables are expected to be lower than the Company’s previously disclosed floor case estimate of $50 million due to rack architecture changes, with no expected ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026.”

ACC content had been estimated to be substantially higher with 36x2 configurations – it had been rumored back in October 2024 that Nvidia was halting development of one of the NVL72 configurations, the NVL36x2, which linked two 36 GPU racks together in a side-by-side system. Semtech pulling guidance strengthens this view.

The shift in architecture to discontinue the 36x2 configuration was said to possibly “disrupt the supply chain for assembly and cooling solutions,” by removing dual-rack configurations and focusing solely on single-rack NVL72 and NVL36 configurations. DLC suppliers have been pushing back Blackwell’s ramp later in the year, suggesting that the market may have faced some impacts from this rumored design change late last year.

While shifting architectures is not a big deal in the medium-term (as stated above, NVL72 single rack configurations are expected to see a higher mix); it’s the suddenness that Semtech pulled it’s guidance that is cause for concern as the company had reaffirmed its optimistic revenue floor guidance  based on two factors – the timing of Blackwell’s launch and changes in rack design. This suggests both factors may be in play, as a late-stage design change was expected to have downstream impacts on timing for DLC ramping.

Conclusion:
Given market jitters around DeepSeek, which turned out to be a non-issue, something more material related to the GB200s, such as growth slowing below expectations at the start of the new fiscal year, could send the stock below $100 -- which we would see as a buying opportunity.

There is a scenario where Nvidia’s stock marches higher – perhaps based on the remaining strength from Hopper and the B200s, B200 HGX systems and B200As packaged with CoWoS-S and having a lower thermal design power (TDP). Or perhaps the string of suppliers discussed here are simply stating the GB200s are not ramping in volume in Q1 but will in Q2.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iweku5/nvidia_suppliers_send_mixed_signals_for_delays_on/,1740329696.0

1iw1szm,"MadDawg's Momentum Stock Picks - 2nd installment, 3rd week of February 2025","Hi, all.
Unabashed momentum investor/trader back with a 1-week update.  My intent was to just update twice a month, beginning and middle, but one of my picks came off with its 10% trailing stop, so I needed to pick another.  

The kickoff post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1is447t/my_momentum_stock_picks_1st_installment_midfeb/).  

A little branding change in the title:  my initials are M.D., and in the Navy I was given the nickname Mad Dawg.  Not Mad Dog, but Mad D*aw*g, according to the guy who gave it to me.  

I thought that would be fun, and maybe help my posts not get lost in the sea of posts here.  But don't let the crazy name fool you:  I scored highest in my graduating class on the ACT (Midwest, similar to the SAT), got a Mechanical Engineering degree from University of Illinois while being married and having a baby (I don't recommend that), nuclear Engineering Officer in the Navy, federally-licensed Senior Reactor Operator at a nuclear power plant, and now I work for the federal agency that issues those licenses to people.  

And I love the markets and numbers and calculations and probabilities.  And I have OCD, so I don't let things go easily.  And I don't watch TV or carouse around, so I have a lot of time to dig into things.  And at 61 I've been around the investing block a few times and have tried just about everything there is to try.  

And having observed several data points in my investing career that momentum trading works, I've decided to 'prove' it over at least a year.  Hence these posts.  

**Rules:**  
Pick charts that look good over a year or so.  
Put a 10% trailing stop on and let them run as long as they will.  
When one comes off, replace it.  

My original picks, with their 1-week performances (last week was short due to the Monday holiday):  

**FOX** 52.35 to 53.01, *up 1.2%* in 4 days  
**HOOD** 63.31 to 51.60.  Stopped out at 56.97.  **-10%**  
**HWM** 136.25 to 129.83, **-4.7%**  
**IBKR** 236.00 to 218.73, **-7.3%**  
**WMT** 103.72 to 94.78, **-8.6%**  

And just so you know, I didn't cheat with the Trailing Stops by just looking at daily closing prices.  Because a true TS will follow intraday highs and put the Stop Loss 10% below that, dynamically.  

So for instance, Walmart had an intraday high of 104.20 on Wednesday, and taking 10% from gives 93.78.  It got as low at 94.12 on Friday, but wouldn't have been stopped out.  

And tell me, how does a company *beat* earnings expectations and *go down 7%??*  That's Walmart.    
And Robinhood too, except it dropped enough to get stopped out.  

**So new rule:**  
No new picks with only x weeks to Earnings.  

What should 'x' be?  
I don't know, 6 or 7 weeks, so you catch it in between earnings?  
11 weeks, so earnings were 2 weeks ago?  
2 weeks??  
Put your thoughts below.  
**I'm going to use 4 weeks for now:**  
*New picks can't have earnings coming up within 4 weeks.*  
That allows for hopefully 4w of riding the trend up before getting clobbered by missing *or hitting* earnings.  

**New pick:  
SAP** 287.40 [Monday 2/24 opening price]    

How did I choose it?  On Barchart I have a watchlist of ""Top stocks by market cap (over 25Bn).""  362 stocks, all at least $25 Billion market cap.  
I sorted that by ""52W %Chg,"" then started flipping through the ""flipcharts,"" with a 1-year view.  

Until Walmart's earnings-beat-but-went-*down* debacle last week, it was my benchmark, with 1y & 5y charts that looked like [this](https://imgur.com/a/walmart-1y-5y-gHcW2K8).  

So that's the kind of chart I was looking for in this new screen.  

**SAP** looks like [this on the 1-year](https://imgur.com/a/O3adPr8).  
That's a pretty chart, isn't it?  And its next earnings date is April 22nd, more than 4 weeks out.  

And I had kind of a 'rule' before that I'd at least heard of the stock.  
Well, **I'm dropping that rule.**  
Because I don't think I've ever heard of SAP, but its market cap is 334B, and it trades almost a million shares a day, so plenty of people have.   

Please put your thoughts below whether you like or hate what I'm doing.  If you trade this way, I'd love to hear how you do it.

1ivzw8v,uncertainty and inflation,"Industries are facing highly unusual and detrimental uncertainty.

Uncertainty in  
**1. tariff** : They need to have a clear visibility of how much tariff will be applied to which goods coming from where.  
That's the only way, they can plan where and how to shift manufacturing. Without some visibility, even the current goods production carries risk. Does the tariff apply by the time the goods are produced ? the only way to cover the risk is to run minimal production and charge extra to cover the risks. This translates to inflation.  
If they are placing order overseas, like for summer clothing with a Chinese firm, the Chinese firm will ask more as they have to cover for the risk of tariff ( the same risk if they place an order with a US manufacturing, that has some parts supplied from China).  
**2. worker :** The deportation of undocumented workers hasn't kicked on full gear. It's awaiting budget allocation of money. The deportation will cause mass movement of undocumented workers, putting significant pressure on some industries ( restaurant, farms , home builders, home rentals). These industries,  constraint on workers, will have to pay more and raise their prices on goods produced.  
**3. federal worker layoff:** lot of industries depend on either government approval ( pharma, energy, nuclear energy) or government projects ( defense , cloud companies government regions). The current layoffs will cause all these to freeze up in the short run.  
**4. competing tech from China** : Chinese companies are getting more competitive in EV, AI and robotics. Also countries frustrated with US tariffs be more open to China and Chinese tech.  
**5. rising inflation** : the inflation numbers are rising back up in a very troubling sign. The Jan CPI was 0.5. By comparison last year Jan 2024 CPI was 0.3. That's a 0.2 increase. And these are no signs of this trend changing immediately.

The only 2 positive upcoming changes are tax cuts  ( the business tax is only 21%, so it won't be as good as 2017 tax cut, but money repatriation could create one-time large dividend) and crypto laws.

Looks like it's time to keep a more guarded outlook, be more in cash and wait next few months till we get final clarity on the tariff and inflation front and wait for market to adjust to it.

1ivwrt6,Oversold? Why I am Buying / DCA-ing the Dip On Monday,"A lot of Friday sell off was an amalgamation of many things, but here's why I think it's oversold and that that a bounce is coming. Many forgot that the monthly expiration was Friday for the options market. Max pain was around 601 for SPY (where most contracts expire worthless). Market makers dumped most of their hedge by selling their stocks as max pain was hit on monthly expiration and a ton of calls expired so they don't need to deliver the stocks owed (which I bet they will bid back on Monday). Also a lot of puts were bought so they needed to short the market even more in order to hedge (there's a lot of put interest right now; almost a 3:1 ratio). All of this compounded and caused a massive 100 point drop in the market.

Sure the Tariff narrative is sold to us create to ton of bearish sentiment, but as you guys saw, if he says one thing about pausing tariffs, striking a deal, or pausing their unemployment plan, then the market will bounce to higher highs, and those that sold at bottom are going to end up having to buy at the top.

Plan: Overall, I am gonna stick to my plan of not trying to time the bottom, and continue to buy each dip. A lot of stocks like CFLT, UPST, APP, and even HOOD are back to near pre-earning levels even after a successful earnings beat. So as long as NVIDIA doesn't completely s\*\*\* the bed and if Jpowell doesn't decide to hike rates during FOMC, then I am DCAing and buying the dip at open. Buy (slowly) when most others are fearful.

EDIT: I see a lot of people thinking that this is potentially the start of a bear market and I just want to say:  
Sure we may get a healthy correction sooner or later, but as for a bear market... ""Since 1945, there have been 15 bear markets—one about every 5.1 years. The bull market that ended in 2020 to be the longest on record""... This might not even anywhere close to the top. The last bear market ended in October 2022. Bear markets don't happen often and unless there's another black swan event like covid or the unemployment rate hits 6-8%, then the market will continue to melt up.

EDIT 2: bought the dip in monday and some calls for stocks mentioned above. Trump back to talking deals with EU and France. Market is also bouncing.

1ivv6ti,MELI: The $114B Tech Giant You Probably Haven't Discussed Enough,"Been diving into stocks outside the US lately, and I stumbled upon MercadoLibre (MELI). I know it's been around for a while, but searching this sub, I was surprised to see how little it's discussed here. Figured I'd share my thoughts and hear what others think.

**Quick Overview:**  
MercadoLibre is basically Latin America's Amazon + PayPal combined. They run the largest e-commerce platform in Latin America and have a massive fintech operation (Mercado Pago) that's becoming a beast of its own.

**Key Stats:**

* Market Cap: $114B
* Revenue: $18.4B (TTM), up from $7B in 2021
* Profit Margin: 9%
* Free Cash Flow: $6.18B (TTM), up from $356M in 2021
* EPS Growth: 92% (TTM)
* ROE: 51%
* Forward P/E: 51 (PEG ratio: 1.37)
* Balance Sheet: More cash than debt
* Expected Revenue Growth: \~25% (analyst consensus)

**What Caught My Eye:**

1. Their financials are solid and getting better - that FCF growth is insane
2. They're profitable while still growing rapidly
3. The valuation looks high at first (51 P/E), but with their growth rate, the PEG ratio of 1.37 doesn't seem crazy

**The ""But What About"" Part:**  
Yeah, there are the usual emerging market concerns - political instability, currency risks, regulatory uncertainty, etc. But honestly, looking at the past few years, even US companies aren't immune to these issues anymore.

**Discussion Points:**

1. How do you view emerging market risks in today's global economy? Are we overplaying these risks for companies like MELI?
2. The Latin American e-commerce market is way less saturated than the US - how much runway for growth is left?
3. Their fintech division is killing it in a region where many people are still unbanked. Could this be their biggest growth driver?
4. With their market cap over $100B, are they still flying under the radar of US investors?

I feel like we spend so much time discussing the same US tech stocks, we might be missing some interesting opportunities elsewhere. MELI seems to have the scale, growth, and fundamentals that we usually get excited about.

1ivs8vg,Is DIS stock just permanently dead / broken,"Recently bought shares a little bit before their last earnings report on hopes Bob Iger could continue to turn the company into a profitable behemoth again, and looking to diversify out of high multiple tech stocks 

The numbers turned out great on that report - they had beat EPS by over 20% (beat revenue by a hair) and reaffirmed the strong guidance given in the previous quarter. Disney+ has now been profitable for 3 quarters in a row after bleeding money. Parks and cruises are doing great - this quarter even had hurricanes shuttering business and still did had beats across the board

Trading after the call surged up 5% to $118 and some change, then had a brutal reversal midday; it now finds itself at $108 and some change and is just dripping downwards every day

I’m a little confused on this one - since the report, it’s done nothing but receive upgrades, upwards price target revisions (JP Morgan, GS, Morgan Stanley, and a bunch of others all in $130-140 range now), and upwards earnings revisions. And it’s done nothing but go down. 

The only thing I have seen is that Disney+ lost subscribers - but it was forecast, and beat anyways. They had hiked prices and the forecast was to lose 1.5M subscribers and came in at losing half that. Plus, Disney+ is just one of their streaming services - they actually gained overall because Hulu came in strong. Not to mention streaming is one component in Disney’s earnings

I also saw that Cramer has been pounding the table on the stock. Maybe that’s the reason (joking)

Depending on the source I check, sometimes I’ll see different P/E ratios and I find that incredibly frustrating because I assume that it’s because some sources aren’t updating their info in a timely enough manner

(VIGAX, VTI, VIG, SCHD, SCHY, BNDI, JAAA, JBBB, SGOV)

My logic is that my portfolio is not only at an all-time high (+37% since Jan 1 2024), but somehow added 8.5% since the start of the year (figs do not include fresh investment). That seems a bit wild, honestly; it speaks to me of exuberance. And in terms of financial planning, I am already where I would modestly project to be in autumn 2026. So that made me inclined to hedge a bit and lock in that tip-top portfolio value best I can.

Then add in the macro-economic issues that are starting to bubble up: inflation is sticky, consumer sentiment is icky (both of those in the USA and globally), in everyday life everybody is talking inflation again, I'm reading articles about people prepping for tough economic times, DOGE is putting metric shit-tons of people in the unemployment line, government services are going to work with less efficiency, tariffs are still coming, and Trump is a chaos agent. Who know what he cooks up next?

The last bit of my logic is something I've learned in life: I'm an average person and quite the same as anyone else. So whatever I'm thinking, no matter how much the product of my own research and attitudes, is roughly what everyone else is thinking. I'm worrying about prices, I'm re-examining spending plans, I was already stashing more cash.... so my guess is quite a few individuals (and institutions) are also thinking things are getting dicey and asking themselves, ""why not lock in at the top.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ivisj7/if_im_an_average_guy_then_were_all_thinking_about/,1740231111.0
1iviadm,"China risk decreased, USA risk increased?","Could we say that after electing Donald Trump and Elon Musk as presidents we could see the risk premium of USA getting slightly higher and China being relatively less riskier than before? 

Donald Trump clearly doesn't have a plan what he is going to do. He just likes to be the King of the USA. On the other hand, Elon Musk, more widely representing firstly himself and secondly the tech bros is totally different that the ""previous elite"" which has put more focus on diplomacy, ensuring stable and peaceful global order. The tech bros don't give a f about that, their interest is to maximize the development of the digital world and bringing humanity into space and their power. 

While the tech bros are clueless about the history and geopolitics in the past,. Russia and China must be happy. Instead of Russia and China being in the shadows of the USA like in the past I assume tech bros are willing to give them open hands to do whatever they want if they just cooperate with them with the tech visions.

  
This would mean that economically (for China) the risks for China doing something stupid is not as severe as before and the countries surrounding China and whole Europe on the other hand are less attractive due to their weakened security position. I still don't believe investors would trust their money on the CCP.

I am sure Europe will get their act together when they realize the tech bros are not helping them because their interest are in deregulation of Europe by supporting the right wing parties of France, UK and Germany who in exchange would serve the tech bros. This will however not happen, due to people in UK and Germany being on average highly educated compared to  average population in the red states. 

  
China and Russia will of course want to destroy the USA dominance and rules based global order if they are given the chance because it has been blocking their imperialistic visions.  Tech bros and Trump are giving them a chance.

1ivfohf,"Thoughts on Hotel REIT “PK”, “Park Hotels & Resorts”?","I’ve been following them for more than a year now, and it’s likely the most discounted multi-billion REIT. The fair value of their hotels is now almost 2x the price of shares.

Currently my 40% portfolio is $PK, but I’m thinking of going like 90%. Dividends are 10%+, and in their recent call, the CEO showed interest in closing the gap to fair value by doing buybacks of stocks.

Does anyone else have any good insight in this? I’m aware of recession-related risks that damage hotel REITs, or the major loan for a Hawaii hotel ($1.4B) to be repaid by Park Hotels in late 2026. But with how they beautifully handled COVID19 and with a bunch of available resources, I think of worst case scenarios (like defaulting on the $1.4B loan or recession) & they’re probably gonna remain fine even if they occur.

Summary stats: 

* Revenues of $1,730 million , surpassing expectations of $1,400 million

* Achieved Q4 2024 gross profit of $170 million, first gross profit in company history

* Q4 Adjusted EBITDA improved +$729 million YoY (-$277 million Q4 '24 compared to -$1,006 million Q4 '23)

* Q4 operating expenses decreased 15% YoY

* For the full year, Rivian posted a $4.75 billion loss, with revenue of $4.97 billion, reflecting a 12% increase.

2025 guidance expects a ""modest gross profit.""

* 46,000 - 51,000 expected deliveries 

* Expected Adj. EBITDA between -$1,700 million to -$1,900 million

* Expects to expand capital expenditures to $1,600 million - $1,700 million as it prepares to launch its new ""R2"" vehicle in first-half 2026.

And while not the biggest headline stat, one of the more shocking numbers of the report to me was their claim that the material costs of the R2 will be *half* of the R1:

> Our focus on cost efficiency across the business is critical for the launch of our mass market product, R2. The R2 bill of materials is approximately 95% sourced and is expected to be approximately half that of the improved R1 bill of materials.

That's a pretty wild improvement if even remotely true.

1-He states that it is price valuation has ballooned way too quickly and is a bubble. So there will be a massive correction.



2-He states that they only really do graphics cards and software and with such a narrow market focus it makes no sense why they are the world's second most valuable company.



3-He states that ai technology is overhyped and it has reached the top of its s-curve.



4-He states that would be hard to improve the hardware without a breakthrough from quantum computing which will take quite a few years.



5-He states that most modern gamers now prefer older games and indie games.



6-He states that most modern gamers only care about good graphics to a point and the artstyle/design is what truly makes a game look good.



7 -He states the CEO (Jenson Huang) is pretentious and disconnected from reality.

1iuxqa1,"Microsoft CEO says there is an 'overbuild' of AI systems, dismisses AGI milestones as show of progress","[https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-ceo-says-there-is-an-overbuild-of-ai-systems-dismisses-agi-milestones-as-show-of-progress](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-ceo-says-there-is-an-overbuild-of-ai-systems-dismisses-agi-milestones-as-show-of-progress)

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sat at an interview where he outlined the company’s plan for artificial intelligence, surprising some in the space in an hour-long session with Dwarkesh Patel. Nadella talked about how AI's impact should be measured, the exponential growth for compute demand, its practical applications, and how it will affect humans — and Microsoft’s recent quantum breakthrough. However, one of the biggest revelations in the interview was his approach to building more hardware for AI.

Nadella says that Microsoft will still need to build compute that can “actually help me not only train the next big model but also serve the next big model.” However, he also said that “there will be an overbuild” and that “it’s not just companies deploying, countries are going to deploy capital”. The Microsoft CEO said that even though he builds a lot, he also plans to lease a lot of compute. “I am thrilled that I’m going to be leasing a lot of capacity in ’27, ’28,” Nadella said. “Because I look at the builds, and I’m saying, ‘This is fantastic.’ The only thing that’s going to happen with all the compute build is the prices are going to come down.”

He likened this mindset of putting up more compute on the supply side argument of “Hey, let me build it and they’ll come.” However, he pointed out that supply and demand must have some equilibrium, and that he’s tracking both sides of the equation. He said that you have to have proof that initial investments in AI hardware would translate into demand, ensuring that you can reinvest your capital.

# Backing off of AGI

Nadella also said that general intelligence milestones aren’t the real indicators of how AI has come along. “Us self-claiming some AGI milestone, that’s just nonsensical benchmark hacking to me.” Instead, he compared AI to the invention of the steam engine during the Industrial Revolution. “The winners are going to be the broader industry that uses this commodity (AI) that, by the way, is abundant. Suddenly productivity goes up and the economy is growing at a faster rate,” said the CEO. He then added later, “The real benchmark is the world growing at 10%.”

The Microsoft CEO did not explicitly say that his company will stop building AI data centers, especially as the company has just signed a contract to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant for its data centers. However, it seems that he’s already put a cap on their capital expenditure, especially as competitors are also putting up their own infrastructure. Instead, Microsoft might lease capacity from them.

Aside from all this, Nadella also showed off Microsoft’s breakthrough quantum chip, which he calls a “transistor moment” in quantum computing. The greatest advancement here is that the development could potentially make it feasible to build a quantum computer with millions of qubits, allowing the company to build a “utility-scale quantum computer.” Nadella even claimed that they’ll actually be able to build this in about four years’ time.

Defense Budget Considerations: The current administration is evaluating defense budget adjustments, with discussions about potential cuts to reallocate funds toward border security and drone programs. While initial reports suggested significant reductions, officials have indicated a more modest $50 billion reallocation. ​

Competitive Landscape: Traditional defense contractors like Lockheed Martin are facing increased competition from tech firms entering the defense sector. Companies such as Palantir and SpaceX are bringing innovative approaches, potentially reshaping the industry's dynamics. 

Financial Outlook: Given the recent earnings and potential budget reallocations, how do you foresee Lockheed Martin's financial performance evolving in the near term?​

Market Position: With tech companies making inroads into defense, what strategies should Lockheed Martin adopt to maintain its competitive edge?​

Investment Perspective: Considering the current political and economic landscape, do you view LMT as a buy, hold, or sell?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iusmvm/assessing_lockheed_martins_future_amid_recent/,1740149409.0

1iurbtn,Why market-cap weighed ETFs and not valuation based ETFs?,"I have lately seen a lot of discussions on how indexes (especially in the US market) are overbought, and how it may be that annualized returns for S&P500 the next 10 years may be super low (even 0%) if they are based on Forward P/E ratios. Which makes me wonder, why an ETF that is based on market capitalization instead of weighing based on valuation metrics, assuming value investors expect reverting to mean in the future via overvalued companies falling prices and undervalued companies rising prices?



Or how about a combination of both in one's portfolio?

1iuqidy,DOJ Investigates Medicare Billing Practices at UnitedHealth (UNH),"**Link to report:** [https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/unitedhealth-medicare-doj-diagnosis-investigation-66b9f1db?mod=hp\_lead\_pos1](https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/unitedhealth-medicare-doj-diagnosis-investigation-66b9f1db?mod=hp_lead_pos1)

The Justice Department has launched an investigation into UnitedHealth Group’s UNH Medicare billing practices in recent months, people familiar with the matter say.

The new civil fraud investigation is examining the company’s practices for recording diagnoses that trigger extra payments to its Medicare Advantage plans, including at physician groups the insurance giant owns. 

A series of articles in The Wall Street Journal last year showed that Medicare paid UnitedHealth billions of dollars for questionable diagnoses. Attorneys with the Justice Department as recently as Jan. 31 interviewed medical providers named in the articles.

In the Medicare Advantage system, insurers get lump-sum payments from the federal government to oversee enrollees’ Medicare benefits. When patients have certain diagnoses, the payments go up, creating an incentive to diagnose more diseases. 

The Medicare billing investigation adds to the scrutiny on UnitedHealth, the $400 billion company that owns the largest U.S. health insurer and a sprawling network of other health-industry assets including its doctor practices, a large pharmacy-benefit manager and data and technology operations.

The civil investigation, some of the people said, is separate from a longer-running Justice Department antitrust probe that the Journal reported last February. The DOJ also has sued to block UnitedHealth’s $3.3 billion planned acquisition of home-health company  Amedisys on antitrust grounds

A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General, which is also involved in the civil fraud probe, declined to comment. 

UnitedHealth declined to comment. UnitedHealth previously has said its practices lead to more accurate diagnoses, that it performs well in Medicare audits and that its approach benefits patients.

In December, the Journal reported that its analysis of billions of Medicare records showed that patients examined by UnitedHealth-employed doctors had huge increases in lucrative diagnoses after joining the company’s Medicare Advantage plans.

Doctors said UnitedHealth, based in the Minneapolis area, trained them to document revenue-generating diagnoses, including some they felt were obscure or irrelevant. The company also used software to suggest conditions and paid bonuses for considering the suggestions, among other tactics, according to the doctors.

Last summer, the Journal also reported that UnitedHealth added diagnoses to patients’ records for conditions that no doctor treated, which triggered an extra $8.7 billion in federal payments in 2021. The untreated diagnoses stemmed from sources including in-home visits by nurses working for the company’s HouseCalls unit. Each visit by the UnitedHealth-employed nurses was worth an average of $2,735 in additional federal payments a Journal analysis of Medicare data spanning 2019 to 2021 found. 

Last month, Justice Department lawyers from the offices of the U.S. Attorney for Minnesota and the Washington, D.C.-based Civil Division contacted at least three doctors and a nurse practitioner who were named in the Journal’s story on UnitedHealth-owned clinics. One of the people was told the health department’s Office of Inspector General was involved as well.

Three said they were questioned about specific diagnoses UnitedHealth promoted for employees to use with patients, incentive arrangements and pressure to add the diagnoses. At least two provided documents, including a contract with a UnitedHealth unit, to the Justice Department. 

Valerie O’Meara, a nurse practitioner who worked for UnitedHealth in Washington state, said she was interviewed on Jan. 31 by Justice Department attorneys who were interested in the company software that suggested diagnoses and the role of a UnitedHealth manager who she said urged her to make new diagnoses beyond what doctors had treated. 

The attorneys zeroed in on certain diagnoses the company often suggested, such as an obscure hormonal condition called secondary hyperaldosteronism, she said. The Journal’s analysis found the condition was rarely diagnosed by Medicare doctors not working for UnitedHealth.

O’Meara said the attorneys focused on her account of how she was told she could add the hyperaldosteronism diagnosis to patients’ records without a lab test. 

More broadly, she said, “they were looking at, ‘Is this abuse?’ ” 

UnitedHealth has said its practices help detect diseases earlier, saving money for the health system. The company says Medicare Advantage plans generate better health outcomes and reduce costs.

In a press release published on its website on Dec. 30, UnitedHealth said the Journal’s articles “rely on often incomplete and inaccurate data to conduct flawed studies through a murky government ‘agreement’.” 

The Journal’s analyses used data UnitedHealth and other Medicare Advantage insurers themselves submitted to the federal government for payment purposes. Reporters accessed the data under a standard research agreement with the agency overseeing Medicare. 

UnitedHealth has faced investigations of its diagnosis-documenting practices before, and its Medicare payments have been examined in health department inspector general reports. The Justice Department took over an earlier lawsuit by a former UnitedHealth employee alleging the company failed to retract inaccurate diagnoses added to patients’ records.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1iudefo,Amazon surpasses Walmart in revenue for the first time,"Amazon has dethroned Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time ever.

Amazon said earlier this month that it brought in $187.8 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter. That beat Walmart’s sales for the period, which came in at $180.5 billion, the company reported on Thursday.

Since 2012, Walmart has held the distinction of being the top revenue generator each quarter, a title it gained after overtaking oil giant Exxon Mobil.

Walmart still leads the way in annual sales, though Amazon is gaining ground. Walmart is projected to reel in $708.7 billion in the fiscal year ahead while Amazon’s full-year revenue for 2025 is expected to reach $700.8 billion, according to FactSet.

Amazon’s core retail unit remains its biggest revenue generator, but its top line is also being fueled by its massive cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses. Third-party seller services, which includes commissions and fees collected by Amazon on fulfillment and shipping, advertising and customer support, accounted for 24.5% of the company’s total sales last year. Amazon Web Services was responsible for nearly 17%.

Walmart has looked to its chief rival for ways to sustain sales growth. The company operates a third-party marketplace and offers sellers fulfillment services, although both businesses are a fraction of the size of Amazon’s. Walmart has also launched an advertising business and a loyalty program for shoppers, called Walmart+, that competes with Amazon Prime.

1iubyeu,Could this be an insane little risk investing strategy over the long run? I’m new to these direction daily ETF’s,"
Basically there are these new ETF's called direction daily that try to multiply a stocks earnings and losses. For example, there is the direxion daily S&P500 bull 3x(SPXL) that pretty much 3x's the s&p 500 gains/losses. This last year the S&P went up 22%, this 3x direction daily stock went up 59%, which comes out to 2.68 times the S&P 500's gains.

If people view the S&P as a safe bet in the long term that consistently produces 9-10% returns on investment, could I just put my money into these 3x etf's and make anywhere from 20-30% year over year? Where's the risk involved in the long run? I just don't know too much about how these ETF's work and if there are other cons to investing in them. Perhaps somebody here would know more? Or would know another reddit be page that would know more?

Because if this stuff is legit this thing could be the best wealth creation tool ever to exist. Every investor dreams of having year over year returns like Warren buffets 23% anual compounding rate.

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

I think the stock goes to $800 and splits 2 or 3 for 1 and continues to climb higher and raising its dividend.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iu6l14/meta_quick_analysis/,1740078711.0
1iu5tip,Is a ‘wash buy’ a thing?,"Hi, I’m having trouble finding an answer as I’m not sure what sort of terminology to search for.

As I understand, If you sell at a loss and immediately buy the same/similar security, you can’t claim the loss, ie. it’s not a taxable event. Does this apply when selling for a profit as well?

More specifically, I’ve learned that mutual funds are not tax favorable in my situation. So, I want to sell the mutual fund and replace with an equivalent ETF. Will the profits be taxable?

Thank you for the help in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iu5tip/is_a_wash_buy_a_thing/,1740076833.0

1iu4zsy,I have a small Individual TOD account that I'd like to sell off for cash - asking for advice about how to do that.,"Novice here. I have an individual TOD account through Fidelity which I opened about 1.5 years ago. This was a phase in my life where I had time/money to research and invest in interesting company stocks that I thought would be good investments. I started out with about $900 and it's grown to about $1650, with positions in 20 companies across several sectors. 

  
I no longer have the time to dedicate to keeping up with trading and shifting my positions around based on data and research. I'd like to just ""cash out"" this account by selling all my shares and moving the money to a Roth IRA or taxable account where I can just buy some index funds and sit on them.



If I sell and make realized gains of \~$700 (mix of short- and long-term gains and I am in the 22% bracket, so let's say 20% cap gains tax rate overall), will I pay around $140 in taxes? Is this inevitable or since I have a relatively small portfolio are there any exceptions or contingencies I could take to keep more of the money? Or, better yet, is there an easier way to convert my holdings on Fidelity straight to buying an index fund in my Roth IRA (say, FZROX)?

1iu1jy7,Convince me I shouldn't be a bear now.,"For one of the few times in my life, I'm actually worried about markets and the economy. Here's what I see and I'm wondering what are the counter-arguments. 

1. Valuations are sky-high.
2. We're seeing mass layoffs. 
3. The government's role in the economy is further decreasing via spending cuts. 
4. Inflation is still above target; hence, monetary conditions are tight. 
5. Tariffs will further aggravate inflation.

To summarize, money supply is on a downward trend and yet costs will continue to rise. Does this not set up the US (and hence, the world) economy for a recession/stagflation scenario? And how much of a haircut will stocks trading way above historical averages get? 

Currently holding March 21 610 puts, bought yesterday.

*****
> Stock futures moved lower Thursday, a day after the S&P 500 hit a fresh all-time high, while retail giant Walmart slid after issuing a disappointing outlook.
*****
> Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 110 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures shed 0.2% each.
*****
> Dow member Walmart dropped more than 7% after the company said it expects fiscal year sales to grow between 3% and 4%. The company’s fiscal 2026 earnings outlook, meanwhile, was also below analyst expectations. The weak guidance overshadowed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that topped estimates.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a winning session, with the S&P 500 on Wednesday posting another record high. The Nasdaq Composite and the 30-stock Dow also finished in positive territory as investors shrugged off President Donald Trump’s warning of more tariffs.
*****
> “We have been using the word ‘resilient,’” Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at JPMorgan Wealth Management said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Wednesday. She added that she expects another high single-digit total return upside from here.
*****
> “We think that 2025 is going to be a year that investors have a chance to build on strength,” Ausenbaugh continued. “We see more room for this market rally to run.”
*****
> Investors also digested newly released minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January meeting. The minutes showed that the central bank’s officials last month agreed that inflation needs to come down more before they cut interest rates again.

""Obviously, the CRE economy has created strong headwinds for CoStar over the last four years as well, but I believe those headwinds may shift to tailwinds. I believe that the CRE economy has passed its nadir and is moving into what may be a very strong recovery.
Demand and absorption for office space turned meaningfully positive at the end of 2024 for the first time since 2021. Availability rates are falling. Total available space is declining. Sublet vacancy rates are falling; sublet rents are climbing.
The new construction pipeline is shut off and net supply after depreciation and obsolescence is contracting. The economy is strong and resilient. We read stories about major corporations mandating five days a week in the office and then the observation that there's not enough space for the company in their offices to allow everyone to return to work.
In the first quarters of the pandemic, office owners steeply discounted prime office space and leased it to tenants, who normally have a second-generation budget. I believe that we could see very strong rent growth in the years ahead with capital appreciation. We are already seeing sales transactions return to pre-pandemic levels and cap rates are rolling over their peaks.
I've managed CoStar through four economic cycles or four real estate cycles. And every time, the world is certain the office sector will never again regain its value.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1itxurv/cre_appraisal_from_csgp/,1740056185.0

1ituftv,'Stagflation' fears haunt US markets despite Trump's pro-growth agenda,"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/stagflation-fears-haunt-us-markets-despite-trumps-pro-growth-agenda-2025-02-20/

Feb 20 (Reuters) - Stubborn inflation and President Donald Trump's hard-line trade policies have rekindled fears of stagflation, a worrying mix of sluggish growth and relentless inflation that haunted the U.S. in the 1970s, even as markets remain upbeat on his pro-growth agenda.

The potential return of stagflation, which would pressure a range of assets, has been flagged periodically over the past 50 years but not materialized as a real threat to investor portfolios. While economists and portfolio managers are not ready to say that this time is different, the dreaded scenario has crept back as a key risk for investors in recent weeks, as the prospect of trade wars and punitive tariffs cast a shadow over U.S. growth.

""Stagflation has definitely re-emerged as a possibility because we have these policies that could hurt consumer demand even while persistent inflation limits the Federal Reserve's ability to maneuver,"" said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager for Brandywine Global's fixed income strategies. ""It's not a zero-possibility scenario any more, by a long shot.""

A key piece of the stagflation puzzle - inflation that refuses to cool down - lodged more firmly into place earlier this month, when government data showed consumer prices rose in January at their fastest monthly pace since August 2023, bringing the annual rate of inflation to 3%.

The other piece of the puzzle, U.S. economic growth, hangs in the balance, with Trump's tariffs threatening to add inflationary pressure that could tip the scale.

""What continues to concern us more than the risk of inflation is stagflation,"" said Tim Urbanowicz, chief investment strategist at Innovator Capital Management. ""There is that sticky base of inflation to contend with but on top of that, tariffs have the potential to slow down the economy by becoming a tax on consumers and weighing on profits and economic growth.""

A Bank of America survey of global fund managers on Tuesday showed the proportion of investors expecting stagflation - defined by the bank as below-trend growth and above-trend inflation - over the next year stood at a seven-month high. At the same time, investors remained bullish on stocks, with a trade war seen as a low-probability risk, the survey showed.

While Trump postponed imposing new tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico for a month at the beginning of February, he has rolled out a new 10% levy on all Chinese imports and announced tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports.

He has also tasked his economics team with devising plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country that taxes U.S. imports, and this week said he plans to introduce 25% tariffs on autos, semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports.

Some investors believe any hit to growth from tariffs would be temporary.
Over a longer-term horizon, tariffs could even promote growth, said Maddi Dessner, head of asset class services at Capital Group, boosting industries that will benefit from less competition globally. On the other hand, their initial impact could increase price pressures.

""The truth is it's probably going to be somewhere in between those two things,"" she said, adding tariffs were partly why Capital Group now forecasts 10-year Treasury yields at 3.9% over a 20-year horizon, up from a 3.7% forecast last year.

'NOT THERE YET'

Stagflation emerged as a source of anxiety as recently as 2022, when inflation rates spiked and stock and bond prices plummeted, but that scenario did not materialize as inflation eventually eased and growth remained resilient.
Many believe that the U.S. economy will once again steer clear of stagflation.
So-called core inflation at about 3% remains well below the levels hit in the 1970s, when the annual rate of core inflation averaged about 7%. This time around inflation expectations remain ""anchored"", meaning the long-term inflation picture is not fluctuating wildly with each fresh piece of economic data, said Evercore ISI in a recent note.

Still, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, warned the market may be underestimating stagflation risks. The prospect of large-scale deportations of workers without visas or other work documents, another Trump campaign pledge, also would fuel inflation, he noted.
""Tariffs and deportations are a recipe for inflation and hurt growth; both are negative supply shocks,"" he said, adding that negative supply shocks such as a crude oil price surge contributed to 1970s stagflation.

Guneet Dhingra, head of US rates strategy at BNP Paribas, said the market has been ""complacent"" over the past six months, focusing on Trump's pro-growth policies. He said stagflation-wary investors could sell two-year Treasuries, likely to lose value due to higher inflation, and buy 10-year Treasuries that would benefit in a low-growth scenario.

Surging interest in gold , which hit another all-time high on Wednesday, suggests some investors are worried, as gold is one of a handful of assets that hold their value in a stagflationary environment, said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors.

The other big winner would be cash, said Brandywine's McIntyre, but he added that for now he was holding back from making big shifts to cash-like fixed income instruments.

""I'm not there yet,"" McIntyre said.

1itsvsd,"Regular named stock vs the one with ""ADR"" when buying European stocks to protect money from USD losing value?","(It's also because I expect those specific stocks to go up a decent amount, but I got character limited in the title)

What is the difference between the regularly named stock, and the one with ""ADR"", when buying European stocks as an American living in the US?

For example, when I search the stock for the company ""Rheinmetall AG"" on my brokerage's (Schwab) site, I get these two results

**RNMBY - Rheinmetall(ADR)**

**RNMBF - Rheinmetall Ag**

Marketwatch shows Rheinmetall AG as being 932.80 Euros, which is close to the ""$984.8 / 1 XOTC"" being shown on my brokerage's site for the one without ADR. The one with ADR is only ""$136.34 / 1 XOTC"" on the other hand.

What is the difference? If trying to protect against USD value loss, which one does it make more sense to buy?

I don't want to put everything into only a few companies, so the list is long, but that also makes it crazy to research them all in time before any future gains.

The American subsidary of BAE Systems contributes almost half of the company's global revenues, so I ruled out buying it.

1itq3ok,DD - Compass Inc - There's Potential Here,"I'm going all in on Compass (COMP) tomorrow after *hopefully* a small pullback, because I believe this stock is going to 12 or 13 within the short term: a month or two.

**Compass Inc** \- **COMP**  
Real Estate/Tech

**Market Cap**: 5.65b  
**Average Vol:** 6.55m  
**52w High/Low:** 10.25/2.89  
**P/E:** \-32.69  
**EPS:** \-0.31

Obviously these numbers seem pretty bad on their own without context. My guess is that the market is valuing more like a tech-growth stock, and if we've learned anything from Carvana... sometimes the story and momentum are most important things.

Now, I know the real estate market is objectively terrible and probably isn't getting better in the near term, but this might be the exception in the short-term because it has been vastly outperforming the sector and the market. There is a lot to like here. Note: My focus in this is mainly as a swing trade, I don't typically hold long term.

**Take a look at the highlights from today's earnings report (via yahoo)** 

**Revenue:** $1.38 billion in Q4, a 25.9% increase year-over-year.

* **Adjusted EBITDA:** $16.7 million in Q4, including $4.2 million in M&A transaction costs.
* **Net Loss:** $40.5 million in Q4, improved from a $83.7 million loss a year ago.
* **Free Cash Flow:** $26.7 million in Q4, compared to negative $41 million last year.
* **Gross Transaction Value:** $54 billion in Q4, a 29.2% increase year-over-year.
* **Commissions and Related Expenses:** 82.53% of revenue in Q4, up 82 basis points from last year.
* **Principal Agent Count:** Grew by 21% year-over-year, with 3,069 net new agents in 2024.
* **Title and Escrow Attach Rate:** Improved by over 800 basis points year-over-year.
* **Market Share:** Increased from 4.41% to 5.06% in Q4, a 65 basis point gain year-over-year.
* **Q1 2025 Revenue Guidance:** $1.35 billion to $1.475 billion.
* **Q1 2025 Adjusted EBITDA Guidance:** $11 million to $25 million.
* **Full Year 2024 Revenue:** $5.6 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year.
* **Full Year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA:** $126 million, a record for Compass.
* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** $234 million at the end of Q4.

Their financials are trending in the right direction, especially given the pressure the real estate market has been under lately.

So the regard in me came to the conclusion that they are essentially a combination of an Uber and Zillow: that specializing in selling house to the super rich.

*What I mean by that:*

* **The way they are using their technology is potentially disruptive like Uber.** They aren't just a marketplace like Zillow which makes money selling leads; they're a whole ass cloud-based real estate brokerage.
* **Their work force pays them** to use their platform which has a proprietary CRM system, automated marketing tools, analytics, and uses AI to help them determine the price, etc. Agents make commissions.
* **They also do a shit ton of acquisitions (24 so far).** This is strategic positioning to gain market share when mortgage rates finally come down.
* **Keep in mind** that a significant portion of their business and marketing image is tailored to ***the ultra rich***\*.\* From what I could find, 35% of their 22,000 active listing are listed under Private Exclusive. They also recruit luxury real estate agents for this specific purpose.

**I also just got to looking at the dark pool data from today and my interpretation was this:**

**Dark Pool Data:**  
**Net Vol. :** \-3,504,876  
**Net Vol$ :** \-35,889,930  
**Position :** \-13,369,776  
**Position$:** \-110,410,00

Given the massive volume from today's trading sessions ([6X@29.37m](mailto:6X@29.37m)), huge net-short volume that aligns with the price action, and sharp decrease in the rolling 20-day short volume: this appears to be a genuine breakout instead of a temporary pump.

**25%** of the short float was liquidated or covered today with almost no pullbacks at 6 times the normal volume. This means buyers were driving the price action,

The way it melted up, adding $1.5B to its cap makes me think that the market is positioning for a move to $12-$13 dollars per share, with $10 is the new base.

Overall dark pool position is still negative, so that's always a short exposure risk, but I'm biting and going all in tomorrow.

**Bonus:**

***Options are stupid cheap for it.***  
**IV Rank:** 11.45

Anyway, that's it for my first DD. I was tempted to use AI to put my thoughts together, but honestly.... I hate ChatDD.

Now, I've been sitting here typing for over an hour, I'm hungry, and this reminds me of writing papers for college so I'm going to end it here. Let me know if I'm just wrong or missed something.

1itp8rb,"Cash, Gold or Stocks with the looming recession?","
I just inherited 100k from my grandfather and I have no idea how to invest it responsibly right now.  The market seems unstable, but inflation seems close and WTF is going on right now in Washington? 
I know this is a novice question… but I am a novice. 

For Context; I am 30, I own a small country house and another small property, hold about 20k in gold and silver but I have zero stocks, bonds or any traditional investment portfolio of any type. My finances are decent, I make about 70k a year and I don’t live big. I have a 4 month emergency fund, own my vehicles and don’t have any other debt aside from my mortgage. I just graduated college with my Bachelors (two actually) and I have some decent job prospects on the horizon. 

Ironically before inheriting this money I opened a Roth IRA to begin investing in more traditional methods rather than just buying precious metals. 

I considered just buying a some general ETFs, maybe 20k in the Dow, 30k in the S&P 500 and 20k in the NASDAQ?  Also considered buying some Swiss CHF because seems to be a very consistent currency and as well as a small amount of Chinese Yuen for speculation. 

These are just spitball ideas, I’m not familiar with these products. 

Any advice would be really helpful.



Also, I’m 100% happy to just buy a kilo of gold and call it a day.

1itncot,"Palantir plunges after CEO Karp changes share sales plan, Pentagon budget cut report","The share price of Palantir fell as much as 12.5% Wednesday after news that CEO Alex Karp had adopted a new stock trading plan, and a report that the Pentagon has been ordered to prepare to cut the U.S. defense budget by 8% each year for the next five years.

Palantir is best known for its contracting work providing software and technology services for defense agencies.

On Tuesday night, Palantir in a regulatory filing disclosed that Karp’s new plan will allow him to sell nearly 10 million shares of company stock in the next six months.

The Washington Post on Wednesday said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered senior Pentagon leaders and other military brass to develop plans to slash the defense budget over the next half decade. The budget for the current fiscal year is around $850 billion.

The Post reported that Hegseth ordered the proposed cuts to be drawn up by Monday.

Palantir closed trading Wednesday at $112.06 per share, a drop of 10%. Shares were down more than 1.5% in after-hours trading.

The company, whose market capitalization tops $255 billion, in early February reported $828 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024, with adjusted earnings of 14 cents per share.

Before Wednesday’s abrupt drop, Palantir had been one of the top-performing stocks in the U.S. for the last two years, including a share price rise of nearly 50% in the year to date.

Palantir trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 600-to-1.

The Trump administration has been engaged in a wide-ranging effort to slash government spending and the number of federal government workers since President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second nonconsecutive term on Jan. 20.

Trump appointed Tesla CEO Elon Musk to oversee that effort, dubbed the “Department of Government Efficiency.”

Musk and Trump have come under fire for their methods in achieving DOGE’s goal, with some steps being challenged successfully in federal court.

On Tuesday, Karp, who co-founded the company with Peter Thiel, defended Musk during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”

“What the progressive left should be doing is saying, ‘OK, Elon, you’re clearly the most qualified person in the world to do something like this. We want a dialog with you about what you’re doing, how you’re doing,’” Karp said.

“I don’t believe that’s happened,” he added.

1itlt6o,Nvidia Earnings Sentiment,"With the current information I have, I think nvidia's growth is slowing down, and that they're gonna stay conservative to beat earnings. This, paired with their trend of falling on earnings regardless of surprises like during their previous two earnings, is gonna happen again and make the stock dip a few %.

Things to keep in mind :

1. Nvidia is gonna have to address the deepseek impacts, what could they possibly say to deter the fears that AI is getting more efficient to compute? It's not a question of chip performance, it's a question of being able to do the same or more, on less. Deepseek, while clearly did not cost 5.6mln to develop, still came out to have a pricetag that was significantly cheaper than OpenAI's development cost of 20bln (between 1-2bln, and this was on older Nvidia hardware). It's going to get increasingly more difficult to justify their exorbitant prices for their GPUs and chips, margins are gonna shrink.

2. Mag7 Capex investments mean multiple companies are going to be coming up with their own chips, while Nvidia still hold the performance lead on theirs, others like AMD could catch up in the future. Furthermore, Microsofts newest quantum chip just knocked the expectations of commercially deploying quantum computing from a couple of decades to a couple of years. While they don't have the production ready yet, they have all the infrastructure online and ready. Nvidia's monopoly is coming to an end faster than we're expecting.

3. Nvidia historically tends to fall on earnings, their previous 2 reports all led to a noticeable drop in share price, even though they were beating their main metrics by a long shot. 

What do you guys think is gonna happen post-earnings to Nvidia? I'm setting a pre-earnings target of about 145$. Eager to hear what you guys think. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1itlt6o/nvidia_earnings_sentiment/,1740012691.0

Since its heights in 2020, and admittedly some years before, I have always been bearish on Nike thinking they were an old guard fashion company that would slowly deteriote as new kings(Lulu, Aldo) rise. 

But with their new CEO being Elliott Hill, someone who started at the company over 25 years ago as an intern and quite literally worked his way to the top(look at his LinkedIn, he climbed from position to position in Nike), idk why but to me its promising. This is someone who worked in so many different positions and departments in Nike, who kept getting promotions, to me that shows he knows his shit, is good at it, works hard at it.

On top of that, with the Kim K collaboration, I think this could be a sign of Nike really trying to take back the high quality gymwear market while still having shoes, while still having sports, while still having a cheaper market with their outlet stores. 

But this is not really my space. I know more in tech. I know more in the gaming industry. I've hit big with Nintendo's 2017-->2020s run, T-Mobile, recently Palantir, but I rarely own fashion stocks.

When investing in individual shares, it is not a problem to take this into consideration; there are enough shares, and you will find enough shares that act in your own ethical interests.But when looking for suitable ETFs, you are way more handicapped depending on the number of exclusion criteria. 

Of course, it is a logical consequence that excluding sectors reduces diversification.But I myself am currently looking for ETFs that I would like to save in, but I keep coming back to the point that I simply see positions in ETFs that I am critical of. 
(For me, that would definitely be animal testing and the weapons/military sector.) 

In the end, unfortunately, the only ETFs that remain for the most part are those based on sector stocks. How do you do it?

1ithdwd,The new Microsoft work is moot; perspective from a physicsist,"Skip the hype from the popular science articles. Let's take a look at the ""rigorously"" reviewed Nature paper. I have rigorously in quotation marks because the process is far from it. As we will see, Nature forced the paper through while 2/4 referees did not support publication.

The paper is at [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08445-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08445-2) . You can scroll to the bottom to access the referee reports. First of all. You will see that one of the referees voluntarily revealed his name, Hao Zhang. This is the same guy that was found to have manipulated data in a [previous Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03373-x), and this paper was retracted after independent analysis found that they shifted the data manually to make the values consistent with a quantized value. So right off the bat, the Nature editor is already not doing a proper job of soliciting referees.

Now let's read the [actual referee report](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-024-08445-2/MediaObjects/41586_2024_8445_MOESM2_ESM.pdf). There are 4 referees, which is more than usual, presumably because it is a high profile work. At the very top, the editorial team has the following comments: 

# The editorial team wishes to point out that the results in this manuscript do not represent evidence for the presence of Majorana zero modes in the reported devices. The work is published for introducing a device  architecture that might enable fusion experiments using future Majorana zero modes.

essentially, Majorana modes are the critical piece of physics required for topological quantum computing, and microsoft DID NOT demonstrate that.

In the first round, 3 of the 4 referees declined to provide strong recommendation for publication:

Ref 1: *In summary, I have no great criticisms of the experiment and the data (which by themselves constitute a good piece of the state of the art of single-shot parity measurements in a hybrid device and their dependence on flux), but rather in the rather misleading way in which these data are presented and the extreme simplifications of the modeling which, essentially asumes a topological state and includes Majoranas by hand, yet again forcing an a priori interpretation of the data.*

Ref 2: *As stated above, the relationship to Majorana physics is not completely certain and needs some serious scrutiny.*

Ref 4: *The authors claim their work is a significant step toward the realization of topological qubits. To my view, however, the reported achievements do not meet Nature’s novelty and relevance standards. Moreover, the conclusions drawn in this work rest on questionable hypothesis and methodologies. As a result, I cannot recommend publication in Nature.*

Now, if you are familiar with publishing in the top journals Nature and Science (and I have published in and been rejected from them), you would know that three do-not-recommends and 1 neutral is automatic rejection. Most of the time, even 2/3 do-not-recommends is a full rejection.

Now the editor gave the authors a chance to respond, which is again already unusual but it's a big team so let's give them the benefit of the doubt.

The authors' reply in round 2 DID NOT convince all the referees and address their concerns. Still 2 firm do-not-recommends:

Ref 1: *Given my overall impression and comments above, I cannot recommend the paper for publication in Nature.*

Truth: John Doe made bad decisions that wrecked the company. 

I know there are so many details necessary to judge I n every scenario but this general hypothetical can still represent what I’m asking which is, Can company X report that John Doe stepped down for no company-related reasons when the truth will be evident come earnings report that John Doe tanked the company?

Microsoft on Wednesday announced Majorana 1, its first quantum computing chip. 

The achievement comes after the company has spent nearly two decades of research in the field. 

Technologists believe quantum computers could one day efficiently solve problems that would be taxing if not impossible for classical computers. Today’s computers use bits that can be either on or off while quantum computers employ quantum bits, or qubits, that can operate in both states simultaneously.

Google and IBM have also developed quantum processors, as have smaller companies IonQ and Rigetti Computing. Microsoft’s quantum chip employs eight topological qubits using indium arsenide, which is a semiconductor, and aluminum, which is a superconductor. A new paper in the journal Nature describes the chip in detail.

Microsoft won’t be allowing clients to use its Majorana 1 chip through the company’s Azure public cloud, as it plans to do with its custom artificial intelligence chip, Maia 100. Instead, Majorana 1 is a step toward a goal of a million qubits on a chip, following extensive physics research.

Rather than rely on Taiwan Semiconductor or another company for fabrication, Microsoft is manufacturing the components of Majorana 1 itself in the U.S. That’s possible because the work is unfolding at a small scale.

“We want to get to a few hundred qubits before we start talking about commercial reliability,” Jason Zander, a Microsoft executive vice president, told CNBC.

In the meantime, the company will engage with national laboratories and universities on research using Majorana 1. 

Despite the focus on research, investors are fascinated by quantum.

IonQ shares went up 237% in 2024, and Rigetti gained nearly 1,500%. The two generated a combined $14.8 million in third-quarter revenue. Further gains came in January, after Microsoft issued a blog post declaring that 2025 is “the year to become quantum-ready.”

Microsoft’s Azure Quantum cloud service, which lets developers experiment with programs and algorithms, offers access to chips from IonQ and Rigetti. It’s possible that a Microsoft quantum chip might become available through Azure before 2030, Zander said.

“There’s a lot of speculation that we’re decades off from this,” he said. “We believe it’s more like years.”

Rather than exist as a stand-alone category, quantum computing might end up boosting other parts of Microsoft. For example, there’s Microsoft’s AI business, which has an annualized revenue run rate that exceeds $13 billion. Quantum computers could be used to build data used to train AI models, Zander said. 

“Now you can ask it to invent some new molecule, invent some new drug, something that really would have been impossible to do before,” Zander said.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1itekzw/microsoft_reveals_its_first_quantum_computing/,1739994238.0

Some have even mentioned Robinhood's comeback. Now, I am wondering if anyone thinks there are other comebacks like this on the horizon.

1it8chl,Can we All Just Zoom Out?,"I want to start by saying this is not a political take, purely a perspective on the history of the stock market. 

I see so many posts about how the stock market is going to crash because of Trump, or because some other global event. 

And honestly, in my opinion, posts like this are sort of dramatic. Let’s realize that the last 100 years the stock market has pretty much continued to go up (with some crashes mixed in) despite everything that’s going on. Including world wars, the Great Depression, major hurricanes, major earthquakes and fires, wars with Korea, wars with Vietnam/Afganistan, constant Middle East fighting, several political scandals like watergate, the 2008 recession that scared everyone, a global pandemic, the Cold War, and so many different things. 

At the end of the day, US companies have and will continue to make more and more insane amounts of money. Stocks will continue to rise even after some downfalls. Trump will only be president for 4 years if not less if something were to happen to him in old age. 

If you’re gonna retire in less than 5-10 years you shouldn’t be 100% in stocks anyways. If you’re going to be retiring in 25-30 years this is all just a blip on the screen. Go pick a spot on the stock market anywhere the last 100 years and then look up news articles from that year. People were scared of something. Yet compare that stock price to the stock price now and you’ll find you would have made a lot of money despite everything that’s happened since that year. 

Just feels like we all get caught up in the day to day and need to zoom out sometimes. Don’t stress yourself out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1it8chl/can_we_all_just_zoom_out/,1739979513.0

But being able to make an extra 10-50% on a trade is huge and adds up really quickly.

Edited to add it’s all based on large volume going in but not a lot of movement. Pretty simple strategy I can’t post pics so kinda hard to show you. Just look at stocks with unusual volume and if they are up on the day but don’t have a lot of price movement.

1it23j7,How to deal with the fear of a crash and a lost decade?,"Hey all, TLDR is what the title says. I have a portfolio where I am currently probably taking more risk than I can stomach, and whenever I end up being in a spot where I have put more than 50% of my Net worth in the stock market, this is how I feel. Of course, I know that if I didn't feel that way also 4-5 years ago I would have a lot more money now.  I am also heavily invested in China now. I believe they are set to go on a bull run, but of course maybe they fall 50% again also.

My investment in China is for two reasons: a) I truly believe they are undervalued and the slow reduction of political risk when Xi starts supporting private businesses will rever them back to their true value, b) a combination of a) with some emotional investing. I lost a lot on China in the past and I want to see it rebound. At the same time I am salty for all the gains I left on the table on PLTR. This is emotional investing. But I can't help it. I also can't stop it yet (i.e. I cannot sell my China exposure until mid March as I added to my position recently and my employer has a rule that doesn't allow me to reverse trade ISINs for 30 days.)

Below my portfolio percentages, on a 235k portfolio. I'm shitting my pants now because - even though I don't necessarily need this money (at least the amount that is invested) in the next 10 years, I also have trouble dealing with the idea of my hard earned money possibly droppnig by 40-50+% and needing 10 years to rebound. How can I forget this feeling? When I am less than 50% invested, then I always tell myself ""if there is a crash, you have 50% left to DCA and then you can recover faster). 

An idea is to switch to a golden butterfly, which should have lower drops, but I really, really, really, do not like bond ETFs.

For reference, I live in Europe, in a country where tax for UCITS ETF capital gains is 0%.

I would appreciate any advice on how to shake this feeling off and go all in in some boglehead type portfolio (or Golden butterfly - but I really don't like 40% exposure to bond ETFs). Or any other portfolio. How can I end up investing at least 200k without this feeling. Or any strategies to hedge risk.

1isldc2,Goog - undervalued mag 7,"I don’t really understand why goog has been trailing vs the other mag7.

Revenue for 2024 was bananas, they are working on all the sectors that will deliver growth in the coming years with cloud, AI, YouTube (and potentially competing with tiktok), ads, quantum, self driving…

They have announced a massive capex investment for 2025 around 75b$ vs 52b$ for 2024 - but when you look at the financial statements that would be the only negative side (as it impacts free cash flow)

This is directly answering one of the issues they had with their capabilities to answer demand for their cloud services as the CFO said that they reached peak capacity in Q4 2024.

Could anyone point out what I am missing ?

1isjjty,How do bond ETFs work?,"I have a noobie question. I am not sure how bond ETFs work honestly. Take for example the Bond etfs that are proposed for a golden butterfly portfolio, TLT for logn term and SHY for short term. My questions:

1) Are these giving a yield (coupon)? If I look them up in Yahoo it shows a yield of 4.27% for TLT and 3.9% for SHY

2) Why are they fluctuating so much? I see prices have dropped a lot in the last 5 years (I guess due to the IR increases), so I guess they don't work as a normal bond that you can keep to maturity and take your initial capital back?

  
Example: If I make a fake portfolio on Yahoo finance starting from 2nd January 2020 and I add SHY and TLT, then TLT is -35.5% and SHY is -3%. Why does TLT fluctuate so much? And does it calculate yields in there? I don't see any coupons being shown as income.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1isjjty/how_do_bond_etfs_work/,1739902939.0

> Cantor Fitzgerald believe that Intel's situation is complex, but they see validity in recent news reports suggesting that a division of Intel's DesignCo and Intel Foundry Services (IFS) is likely. They noted that the restructuring process appears to be in its early stages, with the new administration at Intel pushing forward with the plans. The firm also anticipates that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) will agree to be involved in managing IFS, under conditions that would be favorable to them.

> TSMC is considering acquiring a majority stake in Intel Corp .'s factories, a move requested by the Trump administration to bolster American manufacturing and technological leadership. This potential deal is still in the early stages of discussion. Analysts at Jefferies have maintained a Hold rating on Intel, with a $34 price target, pointing to possible developments involving Intel and TSMC

1ishq6t,Breaking: HERC Holdings ($HRI) holdings just became the third largest equipment rental company with today's acquisition.,"They completely outplayed United Rentals. Swooping in and purchasing one of the largest competitors by outbidding United. That gives Herc roughly an equal market share with United Rentals.

The kicker? United rentals commands about a 10x market cap compared to $HRI. I'm not saying they will reach equality, but the purchase involved debt and stock, and the law of efficient markets brought HRI down today. I scooped up a ton of shares, initiating a position.

Herc is based near me in SWFL, I saw them spin off of Hertz Rentals some years ago. With good execution, they become market leader and the stock rises accordingly.

There is barely ANY trading volume in this stock. If they perform as expected, they will become a market leader in \~2 years.

 my position: Shares and Calls. 100 + margin @ $169 and 13 3/21 calls expiring 3/21.

1isdmoi,These are the stocks on my watchlist (02/18),"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Most interesting news today is the hope that the meeting between Russian/US officials may end the three-year war in Ukraine, in addition to release of the Grok-3 model from xAI (Elon Musk's AI startup.)

News: [Musk S Xai Debuts Grok 3 Ai Bot Touting Benchmark Superiority](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-18/musk-s-xai-debuts-grok-3-ai-bot-touting-benchmark-superiority)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)/[**SMH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)/every semis and AI facing stock

**Catalyst:** Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has unveiled its latest model, Grok-3, claiming it surpasses competitors like GPT-4o, Google Gemini, DeepSeek V3, and Claude.

These assertions have not been independently verified by the open sourcen community but it wouldn't be surprising if it could surpass 4o (the model is close to a year old now)

**Technicals:** No real level I've been watching in NVDA, SMH, already positioned long. Note that xAI uses NVDA GPU's specifically in their super computer.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen a very strong recovery since the Deepseek fears caused a selloff. Personally I don't think xAI will cause the same effect that Deepseek did, but I think that the semis are a winner of this again.

**Risks:** Unverified performance claims may lead to skepticism among investors and potential customers, impacting adoption rates and market trust. XAI has a “Colossus supercomputer,” for training AI, which it said last year was utilizing a cluster of 100,000 advanced Nvidia GPUs for AI training.

Today, the company revealed that it doubled the size of its GPU cluster for the training of Grok 3.

**Related Tickers:** ARM, AMD, INTC

**Offhand Comments:** May see reversal of news if performance doesn't match claims.

**Ticker:** [**HEES (Herc Holdings Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HEES&p=d)

**Catalyst:** HEES has confirmed a $105 per share acquisition offer from Herc Rentals, surpassing the previous $92 per share bid from United Rentals.

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level. They've accepted the bid so we might see trading closer to that bid price in the near future.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Equipment rental industry is witnessing consolidation due to decelerating growth since 2023 (other than that nothing explosive)

**Risks:** The bidding war may escalate acquisition costs, potentially leading to overvaluation and financial strain for the acquiring company.

**Related Tickers:** URI, HRI

**Ticker:** [**NKE (Nike Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Nike has announced a new brand collaboration with SKIMS, launching a line called NikeSKIMS.

**Technicals:** Watching $75 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SKIMS is pretty popular- mainly does underwear/loungewear/shapewear but this might be more focused on athleisure. This could potentially make a difference in NKE sales- SKIMS also collaborated with The North Face in the past, so worth keeping track of this for future catalysts in case they work with other brands.

**Related Tickers:** LULU, UAA

**Tickers:** [**LMT (Lockheed Martin )**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LMT&p=d)**/**[**GD (General Dynamics )**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GD&p=d)**/**[**RTX (Raytheon)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RTN&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Unconfirmed reports suggest that President Trump plans to demand $500 billion from Ukraine and seek U.S. control over the country's mineral resources.

These claims have not been reported by major U.S. news outlets but have appeared in international media (from India, Canada, UK)

**Technicals:** This catalyst has been ""semi-leaked"" for the past week but not ""fully confirmed"", but we would likely see a selloff in defense stocks if true.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** These companies would go to the downside from an end to the Ukraine war, and spike if talks aren't successful.

**Risks:** Pretty much a ""wait for the news announcement"" kind of trade, pretty straightforward.

**Related Tickers:** BA, NOC, HAL

**Ticker:** [**BIDU (Baidu)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BIDU&p=d)

**Catalyst:** BIDU earnings with an EPS of ¥19.18 vs ¥14.13. Revenue of ¥34.1 billion vs ¥33.4 billion.

The company noted a 178% quarter-over-quarter increase in external API calls for its ERNIE AI bot and expects its AI investments to deliver more significant results in 2025.

Additionally, Apollo Go has commenced 100% fully driverless operations across China since February.

  
**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The technology sector is rapidly advancing in AI and autonomous driving technologies. Something interesting over the weekend was Xi meeting with private sector business leaders, signaling that China would be more friendly to business leaders (like Jack Ma)  
  
**Risks:** It's China.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1is447t,"My Momentum Stock Picks - 1st installment, mid-Feb","*Edited 2/18/25 to add stock prices from 2/18 market open.*  
*Edited 2/19/25 to add 2 'value' picks for comparison.*

Hi, all.  
I'm an unabashed momentum/performance chaser.  I used to hope for a month or two of continuation, but as I've aged and mellowed I'm looking more for 6 months to 1 year out.  

I started a thread a few days ago called [How I Pick Stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iprnuo/how_i_pick_stocks_anyone_else/), hoping to find like-minded people.  I found a few, but in general I got negativity.  Even a recommendation to ""VOO and chill""; here in r/Stocks and not r/Investing, I couldn't believe it.  
I also asked some of the nay-sayers to tell us how they pick stocks, but none did.  

So here's my thesis: picking winning stocks doesn't have to be hard.  Look at a chart and if it's going up smoothly over a year or more, that company is probably a pretty good one that's doing good things in the world.  

My benchmark these days is Walmart.  Here's its [1-year & 5-year charts](https://imgur.com/a/walmart-1y-5y-gHcW2K8).  Just steadily up and to the right.  [FOX](https://imgur.com/a/fFAXqeF) is even smoother on the 1y, but not as good on the 5y.  

Those are the kinds of stocks I'll be looking for: up and to the right, smoothly. Probably for a year or more.  And they'll need to be companies I've at least heard of, which generally means they'll be ""large enough.""  I won't be looking at Fundamentals or P/Es or dividends or anything else.  *Just price action.*  

If you explained very basically a stock price chart to a 5th grader, and then asked them if they'd rather have their report card money in [AMD or WMT](https://imgur.com/a/Zz6hZee), those are the kinds of choices I'll be making.  

If it's going up, buy it.  When it stops going up, sell it and buy something else.  

And this isn't something that should take a lot of time.  To that end, I'll post updates twice a month: at the beginning, and in the middle.  This starting one is in the middle.  Being that it's the first one, the 5 picks I make will go on at the Opening price on Tuesday 2/18/25 for each ticker.  

In practice I'd put a **10% trailing stop** on each one, so I'll do that here, virtually.  Those would track intra-day highs, but I might not track them to that level of detail.  Closing-to-closing should be close enough.  And I guess that's about it for the rules.  I'll post percent gains or losses for each position each update.  

My first 5 picks, in alphabetical order:  
**FOX** at 52.35, **the open on Tuesday, 2/18/25.** (Monday was a holiday.)    
**HOOD** 63.31  
**HWM** 136.25  
**IBKR** 236.00  
**WMT**  103.72  

-------------------------------------------------------------
*Edited on 2/19/25 (and 2/22) to add:*  
Value picks:  (all at the open Tuesday, 2/18/25)  
**AMD** 114.05  
**AMZN** 228.82  
**EL** 69.60  
**ELF** 73.32  
**FUBO** 4.08  
**HE** 10.14   
**KSPI** 109.90  
**META** 736.00  
**NKE** 74.50  
**SOFI** 16.47  
**SHOP** 19.08  

All came from the comments, except one is from my value-investor friend.  
Shoot me your value pick if you want it added.  

-------------------------------------------------------------  

Please follow along if you're like-minded. I'd love to hear if you do something similar, or if you have different/better picks than mine.   
If you're *not* like-minded you can follow along too, but please no ""VOO and chill"" comments.  Tell us how *you* pick stocks.  Or just wait a few weeks or months to see how it pans out before you say it won't work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1is447t/my_momentum_stock_picks_1st_installment_midfeb/,1739852143.0
1is2c12,US Congress Trade Tracker - CACI International ($CACI) - Military Contractor,"\*I'm new to posting on Reddit. If there's a more appropriate sub to post this stock pitch, please recommend.

**Stock pitch:** CACI International (**$CACI**). The genesis of the idea to invest is based on following congress stock trade disclosures and following up with due diligence for potential conflicts of interest (see ""**Cisneros**"" further below). FYI I'm long $CACI.

**Company Overview:** $CACI is an American multinational professional services & IT company that provides services to the US Federal Gov't/DoD/military/etc. (military contractor). A significant portion of their revenue (TBD%) comes from US Government contracts. With \~$10bn alone in primarily new Contract Awards since their Q4 Earnings (08.07.2024) split over a contract term length of \~5-10yrs (which looks to include a small % re-contracting). See the following links for summarized awarded contract details (Ctrl+F: Quarter Contract Awards).

1. [CACI | CACI Reports Results for Its Fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter and Full Year and Issues Fiscal Year 2025 Guidance](https://investor.caci.com/news/news-details/2024/CACI-Reports-Results-for-Its-Fiscal-2024-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-and-Issues-Fiscal-Year-2025-Guidance/default.aspx)

3. [CACI | CACI Reports Results for Its Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter and Raises Fiscal Year Guidance](https://investor.caci.com/news/news-details/2025/CACI-Reports-Results-for-Its-Fiscal-2025-Second-Quarter-and-Raises-Fiscal-Year-Guidance/default.aspx)

**$CACI provides the following Services** (summarized via Copilot AI):

* Intelligence Solutions: Offering advanced analytics, cyber security, and intelligence operations support.
* Engineering Services: Providing systems engineering, logistics, and lifecycle support.
* IT Solutions: Delivering enterprise IT, network modernization and software development.
* Mission Support: Enhancing operational readiness and mission success through various support services

**Share Price:** Plummeting. Share price is down \~40% since Nov 2024, which aligns in timing with Trump's formation of DOGE announcement. Negative sentiment seems to suggest major concerns for government contracting companies re: DOGE cost cutting initiatives. Fair, I'm sure there's bloat with government contractors. However, this is all despite $CACI posting strong Q2 2025 Earnings. (see below)

$CACI also went as far to call out DOGE as a positive in their recent Q2 2025 earnings deck (01.23.2025)

[PowerPoint Presentation](https://s21.q4cdn.com/708811725/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/CACI-Q2-FY25-Earnings-Slides-vFINAL.pdf) (see slide 6)

Q2 2025 Earnings Summary: From Yahoo (01.22.2025)

*""Revenues of $2.1 billion, up 14.5% YoY*

*Net income of $109.9 million and diluted EPS of $4.88, up 30% YoY*

*Adjusted net income of $134.2 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $5.95, up 36% YoY*

*EBITDA of $232.9 million and EBITDA margin of 11.1%, up 180 bps YoY""*

CEO Message: ""Our second quarter reflected another exceptional period for CACI. Financial results were strong across the board with double-digit revenue growth, increased profitability, healthy cash flow, and growing backlog.

[CACI Reports Results for Its Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter and Raises Fiscal Year Guidance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/caci-reports-results-fiscal-2025-211500175.html)

Enter Congressman **Gilbert Cisneros** (Dem / House / California).

**Gilbert Cisneros** disclosed dozens of trades on Feb 11th, with $CACI standing out as a significant investment of $15-50k (aka upwards of approx. \[30%\] of a congressman's gross annual salary). Note: It seems that a lot of these trades are going under the radar with the sheer number of disclosure / trade volume recently.

Cisneros purchased $CACI on Jan. 31, 2025 at \~$386; price is now \~$338 (-12%).  

**Potential Conflict of Interests (via Copilot):**

1. Gilbert Cisneros sits on the **House Committee on Armed Services (HASC)**, responsible in-part for:

   * Oversight and legislation related to the DoD, and the US Armed forces
   * Defense Policy: Shaping and funding defense policies and programs.
   * Military Operations: Overseeing ongoing military operations.
   * Acquisition and Industrial Base Policy: Managing defense procurement and industrial base policies.
   * Technology Transfer and Export Controls: Regulating the transfer of defense-related technologies

CACI International operates in areas such as defense technology, cybersecurity, and intelligence solutions, which fall under the HASC committee's jurisdiction. The HASC ensures that companies like CACI comply with defense policies and contribute to national security objectives.

 2. Additionally, Gilbert Cisneros sits on the **Intelligence & Special Operations subcommittee**, responsible in-part for:

* Military and National Intelligence: Overseeing intelligence operations and programs
* Counter-Terrorism and Counter-Proliferation: Managing efforts to counter terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
* Special Operations Forces: Supervising the activities and policies related to special operations force

CACI International provides intelligence and cybersecurity solutions, making it relevant to this subcommittee. The subcommittee ensures that CACI's services align with national security and intelligence strategies.

3. Additionally, Gilbert Cisneros sits on the **Military Personnel subcommittee**, responsible in-part for:

* Military Personnel Policy: Managing policies related to military personnel and their families.
* Military Health Care: Overseeing health care services for military personnel.
* Morale, Welfare, and Recreation: Ensuring the well-being and morale of service members.
* Military Education and Training: Supervising educational programs for military personnel

These committees play a significant role in military modernization. It oversees the Department of Defense (DoD) and is responsible for the annual defense authorization bill, which includes funding and policy decisions related to military modernization.

Previously, Cisneros, as the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel Readiness (under Biden's term), was involved in the decision to cancel the ongoing work for the military's new MyTravel program, which was to modernize / replace the DefenseTravelSystem. Personally, I don’t know enough to speak more critically about this - but I found it interesting that $CACI does IT network modernization as part of their offered solutions. (see - [Lawmaker summons Pentagon official over canceled travel software](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2023/07/03/lawmaker-summons-pentagon-official-over-canceled-travel-software/))

**TLDR:** Why is a US Congressman spending 10-30% of their gross annual salary, buying shares in a publicly traded military services company ($CACI) while (1.) the share price is plummeting, and (2.) while also sitting on congressional committees that oversee the same said company.  

Yes, this is speculative in nature, and I am not an investment professional.

If you've made it this far reading, I have to say, a part of the reason I'm making this post is my surprise by the lack of attention towards this particular trade disclosure. Congress buying military stocks usually gets a lot of media buzz. For example, Congresswoman **Debbie Wasserman Schulz** disclosed on Nov 20, 2024 she bought shares in **Viasat** (a satellite company with military contracts). Share price skyrocketed +40% over the next few days thereafter - to which I don't believe there was any other coincidental bullish catalysts at that time. Come Dec 2024, Viasat won a significant military contract. All the while Debbie sits on a congress committee impacting military contracts (House Committee on Appropriations). Said simply, I believe there's a correlation between politicians buying shares in military companies, and future good news for said military company.

If you have any value-add due diligence or contrarian viewpoints, feel free to share. I'm hoping this post grabs someone's attention with a deep understanding of this company/industry. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1is2c12/us_congress_trade_tracker_caci_international_caci/,1739846549.0
1is1rrv,What is so difficult about beating the market?,"
I’m 20 years old and fairly new to investing. Deposited 80% of my investments into VT & VOO (inspired by Bogleheads) and the other 20% in individual stocks. So far I’ve lost 2% due to some stupid decision-making when I just began but since then things have been improving (thankfully). 

But I’m seeing statistics that something like 90% of retail investors underperform the S&P 500 and 95% of day traders lose money?? I’m thinking of really delving more into retail investing because of people like Chris Camillo but using the inversion principle… what causes such gloomy statistics among retail investors? 

There are numerous strategies I found online (CANSLIM etc) which I haven’t really researched thoroughly or experimented with so my knowledge is painfully limited. Do none of these strategies work? What do the 90% do that outlying people like Camillo don’t? If such strategies are publicly available why is the failure rate still so high? 

Is it trying to time the market? Selling the high and buying the dip? Is it emotional investing or just poor stock picking? 

Beating the market isn’t a fool’s endeavour since retail investors have done with with excellent returns but I just really dk what to avoid and what to learn with regards to investing/trading to attain such returns? 

Any edification is welcome. I am really quite new to all this so forgive me if I sound extremely ignorant. 

What should you do and what should you avoid to beat the market consistently? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1is1rrv/what_is_so_difficult_about_beating_the_market/,1739844848.0

1is1fba,"Thomson Reuters stock (TRI) was falsely accused of ""social deception"" by special govt. employee Elon Musk","Below is an excerpt from a news article. I'm hesitant to post any links on this story, because alot of people believe they were politically slanted when posting on a different sub.  After I explain the current news, below is a summary about TRI's present and future, dividend yield, how many consecutive raises and etc.  This is not intended to be a political post !

Thomson Reuters denied on Thursday accusations that the company was involved in ""large-scale social deception"" on behalf of the US government, saying the claims misrepresented its work with the Department of Defense.

On Wednesday, billionaire Elon Musk posted on X: “Reuters was paid millions of dollars by the US government for ‘large scale social deception.’ They’re a total scam.”

On Truth Social, US President Donald Trump echoed the claim, calling Reuters “Radical Left” and demanding that it “GIVE BACK THE MONEY, NOW!”

Thomson Reuters Special Services CEO Steve Rubley told CNN that “recent public discourse” has “inaccurately represented the nature of the business” between Thomson Reuters Special Services (TRSS) and the Department of Defense.

He added that the accusations wrongly conflated the Reuters news agency with TRSS, which are separate legal entities that operate “independently” and have separate boards of directors.

So basically Thomson Reuters news agency (ticker symbol TRI) and Thomson Reuters Special Services are two separate divisions. Both are owned by parent company Thomson Reuters Corp. TRI stock did not recieve any govt money and, this issue has nothing to with them. Still TRI's stock fell 3% this past Friday. This happened after the price just rallied to all time highs, after releasing earnings on Feb 6th. I belive it's reasonable to assume that the false allegations caused the share price drop this past Friday. Though I could be wrong, and this could be a pullback or a little of both. Even now TRI stock is still up 12% in the past 30 days.

Thomson Ruters (TRI) stock is viewed as a boring news stock. Yet it is actually a sleeper Tech stock, and one that pays a Dividend at that. TRI just raised their dividend by 10% after lastest earnings and has a current yield of 1.38%. They have also raised their dividend for 32 consecutive years. TRI will be moving to the Nasdaq and leaving the NYSE by approximately Feb 25th. TRI is one of the more solid dividend stocks that I have never seen mentioned on this sub. They serve the Law and Tax industry with generative AI software and applications. They also happen to invest up to 200 million a year into AI via Venture Captial. One of the 23 companies they invested was an AI company, and they later bought that company.

From this Stock Titan Article here ...

https://www.stocktitan.net/news/TRI/thomson-reuters-announces-new-150m-corporate-venture-capital-kgryjz8tu42j.html

Thomson Reuters (NYSE/TSX: TRI) has announced the launch of its second Corporate Venture Capital Fund, valued at $150 million. This new fund builds upon the success of its first $100 million fund launched in 2021. Operating as Thomson Reuters Ventures, Fund 2 will target Series A investments in early-stage technology companies across Legal Technology, Tax & Accounting, Fintech, Risk Fraud & Compliance, and News & Media markets.

The first fund has already made 23 investments, including Materia, an agentic AI company that was later acquired by Thomson Reuters. The new fund will maintain a focus on financial discipline and companies developing technologies addressing professional challenges, particularly in Gen AI applications. The initiative is part of Thomson Reuters' 'Build, Partner, Buy' strategy, aiming to strengthen its leadership position in professional technology solutions.

For those of you who only hold Index funds, mutual funds, Reits and etc. you are better off ignoring this. For those of you interested in a good growing stock that pays a Dividend, you might want to take a deeper look into TRI. TRI provides you significant growth potentia (imo), and at the same time offers dividend growth with 30+ years of consecutive raises.

1irz32e,Nebius (NBIS) Has Long-Term Potential But May Be Priced To Perfection,"**While Nebius has shot up 135% in the past year and is approaching fever pitch as a speculative AI infrastructure investment, it does have long-term potential to justify buying on declines.**   
Nebius was carved out of the Yandex group, an erstwhile Russian company known as the Yahoo of Russia. After sanctions due to the Ukraine war and the resulting spinoff, it is now a European company with US operations, little or no Russian exposure, and no additional geopolitical risks.  
**Nvidia has a 0.3% stake in the company, and a strategic partnership to expand AI infrastructure to Small and Medium businesses beyond hyperscalers.**

  
**Nebius has five revenue segments – Data Center, Toloka, Triple Ten, Clickhouse and AVRide.**

I want to focus on the main data center segment in this post.  
**Datacenter**  
The best and most strategic segment is the data center, and the key reason to invest in the company is to take full advantage of AI needs beyond the hyperscalers. I expect at least 100% annual revenue growth in the next two years from the data center, slowing down to 50% in year 3.  
Nebius is going all out in creating enough capacity for demand in the next two to three years.  
It launched its first data center in the US, in Kansas City to start operations in Q1 2025 with an initial capacity of 5 MW, scalable up to 40 MW.  
**Further expansion plans – most likely all of that is Nvidia’s B200 GPUs.**  
• Finland 25MW to 75MB by late 2025 or early 2026.  
• France – 5MW Launching in November 2025.  
• Kansas City – Second facility with 5MW to expand to 40MW.  
• One to two further greenfield data centers in Europe.  
**Datacenter offerings** include computing power or GPU rentals, as well as the more specialized Platform as a Service (PaaS) with its AI studio, which provides customers with options for OpenAI or DeepSeek models, among others. Pricing is based on usage and token generation to accommodate medium-sized, smaller, and/or domain-specific customers.  
**Fragmentation likely:** As the AI data center industry progresses, I believe, Inferencing and modeling requirements will be fragmented and domain-specific. The DeepSeek software and modeling workarounds do suggest this market could easily be targeted by customized requirements, where brute computing power as the norm will morph into specialized or customized requirements. In which case while customers could contract for larger GPU training clusters, they would also look for cheaper inference solutions, which rely on software enhancements. This is likely to happen over time and may well work to Nebius’ advantage since they want to go beyond pure GPU rentals and provide a full stack – this could be both a challenge and an opportunity and it would be crucial to get more visibility in Nebius’ offerings or services as the year progresses specially compared to competition like CoreWeave.  
**Lowering training costs:** While there remains a huge cloud about what DeepSeek did spend on training, and even as 2025 seems to be secure because of the large Capex of $320 Bn committed by the hyperscalers, it would be remiss to not acknowledge that the trend would seek lower training costs as well – in which case a) data center computing power will be at risk and b) pricing could be the main differentiator. As of now, Goldman Sachs is projecting data center demand to exceed supply by about 2:1, and the gap is unlikely to be filled even with rapid deployment through 2026.  
**Spend more to earn more:** Most of the forecasted growth is based on Capex possibly over $2.5Bn in 2025 with an additional $2.5Bn to $3Bn in 2026. Currently, Nebius is well capitalized with about $2.9Bn in cash, but if data centers don’t generate enough cash, there could be dilution to raise more capital or the sale of stakes in their 4 other businesses. This is very likely to happen in 2026.

**Negatives and challenges**

Provide value to customers beyond brute computing power: Over time, data center rentals will become commoditized and price-sensitive. The DeepSeek modeling workarounds suggest that brute computing power will morph into smaller specialized or customized requirements. This could also work to Nebius’ advantage since they can provide a full stack, i.e., a challenge and an opportunity.  
**Pricing could be a challenge:** The trend towards seeking lower training costs should continue – as of now Goldman Sachs is projecting data center demand to exceed supply by about 2:1, and the gap is unlikely to be filled even with rapid deployment through 2026, but Nebius needs to stay on top of it, to ensure they generate enough cash to continue spending on growth.  
**High Capex Needs:** Most of the forecasted growth is based on Capex possibly $2.5Bn to $3Bn in 2025 and 2029 each – currently Nebius is well capitalized with over $2.9Bn in cash, but investors will need to be patient with this outlay first and prepared for dilution.

**Valuation**

Nebius had forecasted to reach an ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) Run Rate of – $750Mn to $1Bn for 2025, which is based on about $60-80Mn of ARR in Dec 2025 times 12. It’s not the ARR in February. It would grow from the current $300 Mn to $ 875 Mn by the end of 2025. Normally annual revenues are much lower than ARR – a lot of ARR is deferred revenue because the ARR includes contracted revenues, which are then pro-rated for the year. An ARR of $875Mn at the midpoint could imply 2025 revenue of between $400 and $500Mn. (This is still about 3x the estimated 2024 revenue of $137Mn – so there is tremendous growth. (But at this stage a lot of estimates!)  
At a market cap of $10.4Bn, we’re looking at over 20x to 25x, 2025 revenue, so the price may have gotten ahead of itself.  
**This is a thinly traded company with rampant speculation, and I think the best move would be to sell 25% to 50% before earnings, should the quarterly results and forecasts disappoint.** **I’m already making a decent profit in a short time, my cost is $32.35,** and plan to keep the rest for the long term. Nebius reports pre-market on Thursday 20th, Feb.  
**I would like to see more visibility before committing to invest more.**

**Competition**

**CoreWeave** (which is private) and also an Nvidia strategic partner had estimated revenue of $2.4Bn in 2024, and with the addition of 9 new data centers to 23 very likely to have around $8Bn of sales in 2025.  
CoreWeave was last valued at around $23Bn but is targeting an IPO valuation of $35Bn thus giving it an estimated sales multiple of anywhere between just 4-9x for 2025, way below Nebius.  
Even if we assume that the other businesses contribute an additional 25% or $125Mn in 2025 revenues we’re still valuing Nebius much higher than CoreWeave – a larger and more established competitor with Nvidia as a partner, and Microsoft as a customer.

**That makes me wary; I’d be happy if my sales estimates are too low, but if they are not, then I would rather take some profit and wait for dips.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1irz32e/nebius_nbis_has_longterm_potential_but_may_be/,1739837125.0

1irsmmj,Under Armour (UAA) shows potential for significant upside,"Hey everyone,

Just noticed this article about Under Armour ($UAA) - link in comments. IMO, it seems like quite a good candidate for potential upside in coming months. However, I've been known for being regarded, so NFA.

I'll just summarize key points for you all:

Current market cap: 2.955B.

Currently trading at $7.10 per share, the company has recently shown signs of progress in its turnaround efforts. In its most recent earnings, Under Armour surpassed expectations across all key metrics, including sales, gross margin of 47.47%, operating margin, and earnings per share. While the company wasn't profitable over the last twelve months, with a negative EPS of $0.29, analysts predict profitability this year. This strong performance led the company to raise its guidance for the fiscal year 2025, indicating confidence in its near-term outlook. At the core of Under Armour's turnaround efforts is a strategy to ""premiumize"" its brand. The company is prioritizing the development and marketing of higher-quality products, moving away from a volume-driven approach. This shift is expected to enhance brand perception and potentially drive improved EBITDA and EPS performance in the coming years.

# SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

* Strong brand recognition in athletic apparel
* Recent EPS beats and improved gross margins
* Successful cost management initiatives

Weaknesses:

* Declining sales across various channels and regions
* Challenges in the Asia-Pacific market
* Ongoing North American market reset

Opportunities:

* Brand premiumization strategy
* New marketing initiatives targeting younger demographics
* Innovative product launches in less established categories
* Potential for market share gains in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa

Threats:

* Intense competition in the athletic apparel industry
* Potential economic downturn affecting consumer spending
* Changing consumer preferences and fashion trends
* Promotional pressures in key markets

# Analysts Targets

* Barclays: $8.00 (February 10th, 2025)
* BMO Capital Markets: $12.00 (December 13th, 2024)
* Wells Fargo Securities: $10.00 (December 2nd, 2024)
* Barclays: $12.00 (November 11th, 2024)
* Barclays: $8.00 (August 9th, 2024)
* Morgan Stanley: Downgrade to Underweight (July 23rd, 2024)

Analysts project that Under Armour's earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal year 2025 will be around $0.30, with expectations of growth to $0.37 in the following fiscal year.

1iro6kj,Grail (GRAL) and the Future of Early Cancer Detection: A Data-Driven Perspective,"# Is Grail (GRAL) severely undervalued? 

In recent weeks, Grail has seen a significant increase in interest, driven by the broader excitement around AI applications in healthcare. While much of the AI hype has focused on drug discovery for cancer treatment, Grail stands out for its use of AI to detect cancer in its earliest stages—before symptoms appear—through its Galleri test.

# Why Is Grail Gaining Attention?

The Galleri test is a multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test capable of identifying over 50 types of cancer with a single blood draw. Until recently, awareness of Galleri was minimal, but the potential implications are profound: early detection vastly improves survival rates across all cancer types. Instead of waiting until later stages when treatment options become limited and costly, early intervention could save countless lives.

As someone who personally took the Galleri test two months ago (no cancer detected), I was impressed by how simple the process was. It’s fascinating to think that a single blood draw could provide such valuable insights. Seeing Grail’s progress from both a user and an investor perspective makes me even more optimistic about its future.

# A Closer Look at Grail’s Business Fundamentals

* **Proven Technology & Commercialization**: Grail's technology is not just theoretical—it is mature, widely tested, and already on the market. In 2024, the company generated $125 million in revenue, with an expected growth rate of 30% in 2025.
* **Financial Stability**: With $767 million in cash reserves at the end of 2024, Grail anticipates sufficient funding to support operations through 2028.
* **Clinical & Regulatory Progress**: The PATHFINDER 2 trial, conducted in collaboration with the UK’s NHS, is progressing well. An FDA submission is expected by the end of the year, which could open doors for broader adoption.
* **Potential for Insurance Coverage**: Currently, Galleri is not covered by insurance, but given its potential to revolutionize cancer diagnostics, the likelihood of inclusion appears increasingly plausible.

# Market Sentiment and Institutional Interest

Grail was initially acquired by Illumina for **$8 billion** before being spun off. As analysts reevaluate its potential, the valuation question is becoming a focal point. Institutional ownership of GRAL stands at **66.6%**, with **ILMN and management holding 14%**. This means that less than 20% of shares (approximately **6 million shares**) are currently in public circulation, leading to a highly concentrated ownership structure.

Key points influencing institutional sentiment:

* **Cash burn concerns have eased**, as institutions now recognize that the major investments have already been made, and remaining funds are sufficient through 2028.
* **Strong sales momentum**, with 137,000 Galleri tests sold in 2024—matching total sales from 2022 and 2023 combined. Cumulative sales now approach 300,000.
* **Regulatory optimism**, with increasing confidence in FDA approval within the next year.
* **Potential market expansion**, including collaborations with pharmaceutical companies in Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) detection and drug development.

# Future Outlook and Valuation Considerations

As of February 15, 2025, GRAL is trading at **$55** at a valuation of **1.85B**, less than **25% the acquisition cost by Illumina** 4 years ago. If Grail secures FDA approval and insurance coverage, the addressable market for Galleri could expand exponentially. Analysts and institutions are beginning to speculate on what this means for Grail’s valuation—some believe a share price of **$150-$200** is within reach in the near term, depending on continued execution and market sentiment.

With less than **10 million shares actively trading**, any increase in institutional demand could drive further price appreciation. As Grail continues to gain visibility, the coming months will be crucial in determining its long-term trajectory.

However, with it being a slow day in the market, I figured I'd share three stocks that I find really interesting. This is going to be a mix of a lighter version of a DD report, but mainly it's to highlight and bring up some interesting names out there. 

1. **$CTLP -  Cantaloupe, Inc**

A quick description of what they do: 

>The company offers integrated solutions for payments processing, logistics, and back-office management.

>It also provides G11 cashless and pulse kits that are 4G LTE digital payment devices for payment and consumer engagement applications; G11 chip kit, a digital reader that accepts contact EMV and contactless EMV payment methods; Engage series comprising Engage and Engage Combo, which are digital touchscreen devices that offers networking, security, and interactivity payment methods; and card touchscreen card readers, including P66, P100, P100Pro, and P30.

>In addition, the company offers self-checkout kiosks, smart store concepts, and the Cantaloupe Go management platform comprising Go Mini, Go MiniX, Go Plus100, Go Plus200, Go Plus300, Go Max, Cooler Cafe, and Smart Market; Go Portal, a robust cloud-based platform; and Cheq products, which supports attended and unattended self-service kiosks for the stadium, entertainment, and festival sectors.

The fundamentals: 

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CTLP&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CTLP&p=d)

While the stock might appear to be expensive on the TTM PE, the forward PE isn't nearly as bad, plus the company is now profitable and growing EPS nicely, so the PEG on the company is actually around 1.12. 

And there was some insider buying recently too: 

[http://openinsider.com/search?q=CTLP#google\_vignette](http://openinsider.com/search?q=CTLP#google_vignette)

What I find interesting about the company is that they are working with sports stadiums with their cashless kiosk systems. They currently operate in over 20 stadiums. It's actually a great case study on it for the commanders stadium called out on their site.

I'm not the biggest expert around the oil market, but it does it does seem like the offshore market is actually growing. Plus add in the new Trump admin who is talking about ""drill baby drill"", FTI specializes in the offshore drilling market. 

I just think what they do with the subsea oil drilling is really interesting, especially with the use of robotics.

>Shale is still growing. But analysts say fields are beginning to get exhausted, so production is starting to plateau. “Offshore is the only place that’s left to grow. The other thing about offshore, too, is that over the last five years, the average breakeven has come down from $75 \[per barrel\] to $50 or even $45,” said Simon Wong, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.

>In 2025, growth from offshore oil drilling globally could surpass tight oil, or shale growth, for the first time in more than a dozen years, according to Rystad Energy. The consulting firm expects that trend to continue.

In their latest investor presentation, they actually called out that the total company backlog is now the highest level since the merger to create the company. 

They also have authorized their buybacks by 1B and have enough to take our around 10% of the float.

1irn4nl,"Trump's Move for Moving Manufacturing into US, is Strategically good for Automation Revolution.","Start by saying, I'm not a Trumper.

Looking ahead 5–10 years, a strategic shift toward advanced, automated manufacturing in the U.S. could yield significant economic benefits. In this scenario, factories would increasingly rely on AI and robotics for design, management, and optimization—enabling tremendous output while reducing dependence on traditional, labor-intensive processes. As a result, the most valuable roles will likely focus on overseeing these sophisticated systems rather than on manual labor.

This evolution in manufacturing is expected to boost demand for companies that supply the necessary infrastructure and equipment—often dubbed “shovel makers.” Firms such as Johnson Controls International (JCI), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), ASML Holding, and Micron Technology (MU) are well positioned to benefit. Additionally, as automated production scales up, there could be a secondary surge in demand for embedded systems, potentially benefiting companies like AMD and Intel.

While this outlook remains speculative, current trends in automation, robotics, and AI suggest that a U.S.-focused, high-tech manufacturing base could provide a strong competitive advantage in the global economy by 2025 and beyond.

This is my Thesis why I think Nationalism is a great priority to have now, because the countries with this infrastructure will win, just like the US won after World War II.

Edit: Yikes, I see you do not have the capacity to look past the word Trump. Okay, my mistake, I forgot we are all hyper sensitive here. 

My main Argument: Tariffs -> Increased Incentive for Moving Manufacturing Jobs into US -> Good for Automation Revolution -> Good for US economy over next 10+ years.  

I can't comment on all the false statements being spammed in the comments by liberals, but I have no arguments for or against Trump, as a person, or any previous president, not worth my time and effort.

1irmza9,Foreign Exchange Impacts on Apple's Earnings,"**Foreign Exchange Impacts on Apple**

The US dollar (USDXY) can have a huge impact on Apple’s revenue and earnings as around 50% of Apple’s sales occur internationally. Much of the past ten years the USDXY has hovered in the 92-98 range. When COVID-19 hit in March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate and the USDXY hovered in the 89-95 range for a majority of the second half of 2021 through early 2022. In early 2022 the Federal reserve started to hike the federal funds rate and did so through the end of 2023. From mid-2022 through today the USDXY has hovered in the 103-113 range. This is is a 10-25% difference. The elevated USDXY poses significant revenue headwinds for Apple as it costs Apple much more to convert back to US dollars on foreign revenue and it also can lead to lower sales volume as Apple has to raise prices in foreign countries to help offset a strong USDXY. A strong USDXY can help Apple when it comes to foreign investment and international expenses, but the revenue and sales impact outweighs any gains in the cost area. Tim Cook cites in Apple’s Q1 2023 earnings call that foreign exchange (FX) impacts had a “nearly 800 basis point impact,” on revenue. In Apple’s latest Q1 2025 earnings call Tim Cook stated that FX would have a negative 2.5% impact on revenue, but that is YoY not compared to 2021 meaning on a constant currency basis compared to 2021 it would be close to the 6-8% range. Below is a five-year chart of the USDXY. Let’s take a look at Apple’s fiscal year 2024 performance with a 6% constant currency adjustment to revenue to compare to FY 2021 on a constant currency basis.

**FY 2024 Example**

Apple’s total net sales in FY 2024 was $391 billion. With a constant currency 6% adjustment it would be $415 billion. Apple’s total cost of sales for FY 2024 was $210 billion. If we add in a 6% negative impact for a weakened USDXY it would be $223 billion. This would mean Apple’s gross margins would have been 52.8% instead of the reported 46.2% for FY 2024. Apple’s adjusted diluted EPS for FY 2024 would have been around $7.55/share vs the reported $6.75 adjusting for the one-tax payment made in Q4 2024. Here is the math:

Revenue: $415 billion

Cost of Sales: $223 billion

Operation Expenses: $57.5 billion

Effective Tax Rate: 15.8%

Total Outstanding Shares: \~15 billion

($415 -$223)=gross margin -($57.5) = operating income \*(15.8%)= ($113.25)/15=$7.55

As you can see, FY 2024 EPS would have been 12% higher on a constant currency basis compared to FY 2021. Gross margin would have been 660 basis points higher. The strong USDXY has a significant impact on Apple’s earnings. I think the second half of FY 2025 FY 2026 could be a big growth year for Apple on paper if the USDXY weakens and Apple’s hardware replacement cycle follows its normal 3–4-year cycle. The last big upgrade cycle took place during the end of 2020-2021.

1ir3eyb,How can I reduce my exposure to US equities given potential political risk?,"I’ve been reading about some radical political theories (including 'Dark Enlightenment') suggesting that the US could shift toward an autocratic, neo-reactionary model—essentially a fundamental breakdown of the current democratic institution and move toward a network-state with a “gov-corp” style of governance. While this is still very theoretical and speculative (but most worrying this crazy theory is looking more and more like reality given Trump's first 30 days), I’m increasingly concerned about the potential for increased political and regulatory uncertainty that could impact US equities.

My current portfolio is heavily weighted in US stocks, and I'm thinking about strategies to hedge or reduce exposure if such a scenario were to unfold. I’m particularly worried about:

* Heightened volatility and political risk premiums
* Potential capital flight and shifts in investor sentiment
* The long-term structural impact on corporate governance and profitability

What are some strategies or alternative asset classes you’ve found effective in mitigating this kind of risk? Would diversification into international equities, commodities, or maybe even cash be a smart move? I'm interested in both short-term tactical adjustments and longer-term hedging ideas.

  
Given the number of Tech-Bro Billionaires at his inauguration they are definitely pushing some sort of agenda, so I don't know how US tech equities will fare vs other US equities... or whether they will just be there to sweep up cheap stock/land/who-knows-what.

So my DD is below. Would love everyone's thoughts. My cost is around $199 and have around 70 stocks.I am holding till at least $260.

**Introduction**

Onto Innovation (Tickr: ONTO) is a manufacturer and provider of equipment and software for semiconductor manufacturers. Their product lineup includes equipment for defect inspection, metrology, lithography, photoluminescence and many others required for semiconductor manufacturing and AI packing.  To put it simply, they manufacture and sell equipment that make sure that chips are manufactured and packed optimally, doesn’t have wastage and meet standards . The firm officially came into existence in October 2019 from the merger of Rudolph Technologies and Nanometrics Incorporated.

**The Bull Case for Onto Innovation**

The bull case for Onto Innovation is underpinned by two factors – the continued growth of semiconductor industry powered by demand for AI, and Onto’s market leadership in packaging and metrology. I am not going to talk about the former but would like to touch upon some details of the latter. Onto’s technology in advanced packaging (2.5D and 3D integration) is considered superior to competition. Further Onto’s metrology solutions (precise measurement of chip components) are industry-leading. Among Onto’s customers are almost all the largest chip foundries and memory manufacturers in the world – TSMC, Intel, Samsung, Micron Technology etc.

Onto’s technical capabilities are also reflected in their financial performance to date. 2024 full year revenue was $987MM (+21% vs. 2023, 15% CAGR vs. 2020) and generated healthy cash of $246MM (+43% over 2023). 2024 Q4 EPS was $1.51 exceeding Zacks Consensues of $1.39 and well more than the $1.06 EPS in Q4 2023. The 2023 closing balance sheet was extremely healthy with a total debt of only $19MM vs. total assets of \~$2B and a cash balance of \~$700MM.

ONTO stock has a 100% buy rating from the 10 analysts that cover it and they have target prices ranging from $230 to $275.

**My DCF**

My DCF is very back of the envelope but the output aligns with the numbers that analysts have come to.

The FCFE is estimated to grow at the same rate as projected revenue growth which ranges from 14% to 26% in 2025. I took the mid-point of 20% and assumed that the growth will linearly taper to terminal growth of 3% by 2034 (which in my opinion is a very conservative assumption). CoE is 11.01% based on Aswath Damodaran’s estimation for semiconductor equipment manufacturers. Ignored the minor debt and any dilution that my come due to employee stock options. Based on this analysis, target price is $255 vs. current price of \~$175.

TLDR: ONTO Innovation with their superior capabilities is likely to ride the AI wave and reach a target price of $260. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ir13lv/onto_innovation_dd/,1739736162.0

1ir0cgi,Any heard of/had experience with ADPV?,"Searched Reddit and Google in general but found close to nothing on this ticker so asking the community here.

Long story short I can no longer actively trade individual equities (work at financial firm with trading restriction). Thankfully all my current holdings are grandfathered, but I am free to trade ETF's and derivatives thereof so I was looking for something that could be a little more aggressive. Looked through a long list of the usual suspects of ETF's, but stumbled upon ADPV. Basically it selects 25 of the top-performing stocks in the market during bull runs, and then reverts to treasuries during bear markets. Ultimately I'm hoping this will get me exposure to new up-and-coming stocks/IPO's etc since I can't buy them myself, and the hedge is more of a bonus than anything.

Here are the drawbacks I can see:

1. 1% expense ratio. I pretty much hold all equities and index funds currently with zero ER or close to it, so this one hurts. But maybe it's worth it to scratch my trading itch which can no longer be satisfied.
2. Low volume. This would be for B&H and not for a huge portion of my portfolio so I don't think this would be an issue but would welcome your thoughts/negative experiences with low-volume/liquidity ETF's.
3. The methodology for rotating in and out of the 25 tickers isn't clear. So that's leaving a lot up to the fund management. Current top holding is PLTR (bought in 2023!) which may account for a lot of their recent performance.
4. Not much history as it's only a couple years old. However looking at their top holdings and buy dates they've done very well getting ahead of the curve on some big movers. Past performance not indicative..ofc ofc

1iqyofa,"Original Research - Avoid Baidu ($BIDU): ""Don't Get Tricked By China's AOL""; OR Why Its “Global AI” Hype Falls Flat","Baidu loves to sell itself as China’s leading AI innovator. Western investors often lump it in with Chinese “tech champions.” But a closer look reveals the truth: Baidu’s overseas presence is negligible—less than 1% of revenue—despite years of flashy announcements about AI labs, cloud services, and self-driving projects outside China. Its so-called global ambitions have barely moved the needle.

Baidu’s inability to generate meaningful overseas revenue, despite years of aggressive AI branding and expansion efforts, is not just a matter of tough market conditions—it is a clear indicator of deep structural problems within the company. This failure reflects fundamental issues with strategy execution, capital allocation, leadership decision-making, and competitive positioning.

In my view, Baidu is kind of like the worst house on a dangerous street: it's an aging property with structural issues, stuck in a declining neighborhood where better-built businesses have already moved on to safer, more lucrative markets. Investors hoping for a turnaround are betting on renovations that won't materialize, while smarter money flows into sturdier, globally competitive multi-nationals like Lenovo, Haier, Xiaomi, and BYD.

Baidu isn’t just in a tough spot—it’s in a market that’s moving past it.

# The Unfulfilled Dream of “China’s Google”

Baidu was once hailed as “China’s Google,” dominating a market where Google was blocked. That moniker created an expectation that it would naturally go global—just like Google did. However, every major overseas push from Baidu has fizzled:

* Japan Search Engine (launched in 2007) never surpassed low-single-digit market share and shut down in 2015.
* Southeast Asia Utility Apps saw initial downloads (DU Battery Saver, etc.) but failed to retain users; many apps were plagued by adware allegations.
* India Ban abruptly cut off a huge market in 2020 when geopolitical tensions led to restrictions on Chinese apps.
* Cloud and Robotaxis remain mostly China-centric, without the global scale of Alibaba Cloud or Huawei’s data centers.

Instead of becoming a global behemoth, Baidu is stuck with near-100% reliance on China’s ad market and domestic AI cloud business. Its “global AI champion” pitch sounds exciting, but there’s little actual revenue to back it up.

# Management’s Stop-and-Start Strategy

One reason for Baidu’s stagnation abroad is its on-again, off-again international focus:

* Internal shakeups and management turmoil kept the business pivoting from search to apps, from apps to AI, from AI to EV software, etc.
* These abrupt strategy shifts wasted capital and left foreign users unconvinced and Western rivals unchallenged.
* ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent moved faster and more decisively, seizing digital opportunities at home and abroad.

All this has left Baidu vulnerable to shifts in China’s macro and regulatory landscape—unlike peers that truly diversified overseas.

# Meanwhile, Other Chinese Companies Are Thriving Abroad

While Baidu’s overseas revenue remains a rounding error, several Chinese companies have systematically expanded beyond their home market—often capturing significant shares of revenue abroad:

**Lenovo**

* Generates \~75% of its revenue overseas in PCs, servers, and services.
* Successfully acquired IBM’s PC and server businesses, scaling up a global supply chain and brand presence.

**Haier**

* Over 50% of sales come from outside China.
* Bought iconic appliance brands like GE Appliances in the U.S., building localized manufacturing and distribution worldwide.

**Xiaomi**

* Aggressively moved into India, Southeast Asia, Europe, and more, combining cost-competitive smartphones with robust local partnerships.

**BYD & CATL**

* Leading the EV and battery space not just in China, but globally—securing deals with top automakers and scaling in Europe, the U.S., and beyond.

**WuXi Biologics, Transsion, Etc.**

Many other Chinese firms, from biotech to mobile phone brands, have established real foreign footprints that diversify their revenue streams.

These Chinese global players compete head-to-head with Western incumbents in advanced economies and capture demand in emerging markets—all while being priced far below many U.S. or European multinationals.

# Why Investors Should Care About Ex-China Successes 

1. Diversification Away from China’s Economy

Companies with 50–75% of sales overseas are far less vulnerable to a domestic slowdown or stricter policies at home.

2. Genuine Global Growth

These firms have already proven they can localize, partner, or acquire to enter new markets—unlike Baidu, which talks big but executes poorly.

3. Undervalued vs. Global Peers

Sentiment around “Chinese risk” keeps valuations low. However, the actual risk for globally diversified firms is materially different—and in many ways lower—than for a purely domestic player like Baidu.

4. Fast-Compounding International Revenues

If emerging markets in India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East continue to boom—or if Western consumers embrace Chinese EVs and hardware—companies like Lenovo, Haier, Xiaomi, and BYD are already positioned to grab that growth.

# The Bottom Line: Steer Clear of Baidu, Focus on the Real Global Champs

* Baidu Is a Not-So-Awesome “China-Only” Story

Its domestic ad revenues are plateauing, short-video competitors are eating market share, and foreign expansions are just pilot projects that haven’t delivered meaningful sales.

* Baidu Overseas Hype Is Empty

A decade of repeated attempts—from search in Japan to robotaxis in the UAE—has not yielded substantial user adoption or revenue. There’s little reason to believe another pivot will magically pay off.

* Others Have Cracked the Code

Lenovo, Haier, Xiaomi, BYD, and others each show that Chinese firms can indeed thrive globally—but Baidu hasn’t replicated that success.

* There's Better Risk/Reward Elsewhere

Baidu trades at a discount that I initially found tempting for my own portfolio. Who doesn't want a future AI windfall? But that bet relies on overseas revenue magically materializing after a decade of tries. If you want an angle on Chinese equities, go for the companies that have already demonstrated they can succeed abroad—and leave Baidu, the “worst house on a dangerous street,” off your list.

1iqyd69,Trying to understand AI profitability,"I’m curious if there are any experts in this field who can present a compelling argument that AI is not just a speculative bubble and that it can actually generate real revenue for companies—beyond Nvidia’s hardware sales.

I realize I'm probably beating a dead horse but AI is drawing striking parallels with the dot-com era. Just as the internet was once hyped to revolutionize business operations, there’s a lot of similar hype surrounding AI. The excitement is real and I do believe AI will become widespread. However, similar to the early days of the internet, it’s difficult to see a valuation that reflects the worldwide impact in the next 1-2 decade.

Let’s take Nvidia and Cisco as a comparison. Both had strong fundamentals and were leaders in selling hardware, yet after the burst, Cisco’s stock fell 80% and it took almost 20 years to recover from its peak. We've confirmed that the internet has truly revolutionized the world but why did Cisco fall so dramatically from the dot-com burst and take so long to recover?

So the question is, if the AI hype fades and GPU demand slows down or fails to materialize as expected, wouldn't Nvidia face the same fate in the early stages? How will companies profit from AI when it's just machine learning? What exactly are we anticipating? Are we just expecting AI to replace employees or, at the very least, drive down headcount to improve profit margins as a tool/service?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iqyd69/trying_to_understand_ai_profitability/,1739729360.0

1iqwcg5,"TSMC, Broadcom consider possible Intel deals to split chipmaker","Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) rivals Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) are considering deals that could split the troubled U.S. chipmaker into two, the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Broadcom (AVGO) has been closely examining Intel's (INTC) chip design and marketing business, the report said, but will only make a bid if it can find a partner for Intel's (INTC) manufacturing business.

TSMC (TSM), the world's biggest contract chipmaker, has studied running all of Intel's (INTC) chip plants, either as part of an investor consortium or other structure, the report said.

The discussions with possible suitors and Trump administration officials, who are concerned about the company seen as crucial to national security, are being led by Intel's (INTC) executive chairman Frank Yeary, the report said.

According to the report, Yeary has been telling people close to him that he is focused on maximizing value for Intel (INTC) shareholders.

President Donald Trump's administration may not support Intel's (INTC) chip plants being run by a foreign player, Reuters reported Friday. While the White House supports foreign companies investing in the U.S., it is ""unlikely"" to support a foreign entity controlling Intel's (INTC) plants.

Bloomberg had earlier reported that TSMC (TSM) was evaluating acquiring a controlling stake in Intel's (INTC) factories at Trump's request.

Any deal for Intel (INTC) would require a signoff from the U.S. government, which has poured billions of dollars into Intel (INTC) under the Chips Act of 2022. The ailing chipmaker has been the largest beneficiary of the $53 billion program, receiving up to $7.9 billion to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and other locations in the U.S.

Intel (INTC) set up its foundry business under the leadership of former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who embarked on an ambitious turnaround plan. But Gelsinger was forced out of the company last year after the board reportedly lost confidence in him.

Intel (INTC), currently valued at $102.19 billion, has tumbled nearly 65% in the last five years. In comparison, TSMC's (TSM) current market capitalization stands at $840.25 billion and Broadcom's (AVGO) at $1.09 trillion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iqwcg5/tsmc_broadcom_consider_possible_intel_deals_to/,1739724337.0

Their owner Ken Griffen is politically connected and he likely knows about something HUGE in the works. On DJT’s recent earnings they said they’re looking for mergers and acquisition target. This could be foreshadowing a highly beneficial acquisition/merger in the works using their $800 million cash on hand. 

There are SO many amazing opportunities that DJT can go into. A merger or partial ownership on Tik tok would be most beneficial. DJT has a huge advantage in a tik tok acquisition since it’s directly connected to the president and the acquisition is being negotiated by the president. Perhaps they could merge with X or Rumble? Those are just a few ideas off the top of my head. 

People LOVE to argue about the low revenues of DJT, but they completely overlook the $800 million in cash on hand which can easily be transformed into sweeping revenue with a savvy merger or acquisition. This stock is being completely overlooked and counted out by everyone on Reddit. They think DJT is a joke but clearly there is MAJOR money willing to bet otherwise. 

Personally I have put $1.2 million in DJT calls and I am expecting market open to be a HUGE wake up call with people realizing that nobody who is politically connected would bet $65 million on a failing business.

1iqh9y7,Original Research: When Does Apple Become a Buy? Or “How Makeup  Really Can Make You the Prettiest Girl in the Room”,"Apple is the world’s most valuable company, the most beloved consumer brand, and the best-run capital return machine in the modern stock market. It has survived every bear thesis, adapted to every challenge, and delivered shareholders a relentless stream of buybacks, dividends, and steady earnings growth.

At 33x forward earnings, the market is pricing Apple as if it will continue this dominance indefinitely. But no company can defy gravity forever. Apple’s next phase of growth depends on emerging markets, where its traditional advantages—brand strength, pricing power, and ecosystem lock-in—are not guaranteed to work the same way they have in the U.S. and Europe.

Much like a perfectly applied face of makeup, Apple looks flawless at first glance. But take a closer look, and a few cracks start to appear. Buybacks are masking slowing earnings growth. Services margins, long assumed to be unassailable, are under regulatory threat. And in markets where Apple is banking on its next wave of users, it’s facing competition from companies that know these regions better and are playing an entirely different game.

The market assumes Apple will extend its dominance effortlessly. The data suggests otherwise.

# The Market Assumes the iPhone Will Conquer Everywhere. That’s a Risky Bet.

In North America, Apple’s pricing power is sacred. In emerging markets, it is anything but.

Apple’s dominance in the U.S. is built on two things: a premium brand and a seamless ecosystem. People don’t leave iOS because switching out of iMessage, AirDrop, and the App Store is a hassle. But in places like India, Latin America, and Africa, the default phone isn’t an iPhone. It’s an Android device, often made by Xiaomi, OPPO, or Transsion, where users have already built their own ecosystems of digital services.

That’s a problem for Apple’s long-term growth. If users in these markets don’t start on iOS, they aren’t going to be locked into Apple’s ecosystem later. And in the places where Apple is growing, it’s often doing so by selling older iPhones at discounted prices—an approach that works for market share but erodes the premium pricing model that has sustained its margins.

Apple is winning some battles, but at what cost?

* **Latin America**: iPhone shipments jumped 21% year-over-year in 2024, but most of that growth came from discounted older models and local assembly in Brazil to avoid import tariffs. The broader smartphone market in the region grew 10% in the same period. That means Apple isn’t necessarily taking over—it’s just keeping up by cutting prices. Meanwhile, Xiaomi continues to outsell Apple, offering comparable hardware at a fraction of the price.
* **India**: Apple is making its biggest push yet, opening flagship stores in Mumbai and Delhi, ramping up local manufacturing, and introducing aggressive financing options. Morgan Stanley estimates India will account for 15% of Apple’s revenue growth over the next five years. But the market reality is stark: iOS has less than 11% market share, and the vast majority of smartphones sold in India cost under $300. Apple has already had to cut iPhone 15 prices shortly after launch due to weak demand. If Apple is forced to compete on price in India, it risks undermining its premium brand without capturing users who will spend heavily on services later.
* **Africa**: Apple has barely made a dent. iOS accounts for just 13% of smartphone OS usage on the continent, where Transsion dominates by offering localized software, low prices, and an understanding of informal distribution channels that Apple simply doesn’t have. There is no clear path for Apple to break into the mass market in Africa without fundamentally changing its business model.
* **China**: The country that once seemed like Apple’s second home is becoming more difficult. Huawei’s resurgence in 2024 cut into Apple’s iPhone sales, forcing Apple to offer rare price cuts on iPhones and Macs. That’s a red flag—Apple has built its entire business on not needing to lower prices to stimulate demand.

The big takeaway is that Apple’s expansion into emerging markets is not coming from a position of strength. The company is selling more phones, but only by making pricing concessions. The North American investor base, still anchored to the idea that Apple can charge whatever it wants, may not be fully appreciating what this means for long-term margins.

# Apple’s Valuation Assumes Its Services Model Works Everywhere. That’s Not a Given.

Apple is no longer just a hardware company—at least, that’s the argument bulls have made for the past five years. With nearly $90 billion in annual revenue, Apple’s Services business is treated as the company’s long-term growth engine, the high-margin hedge against slowing hardware sales.

But Services growth depends on Apple’s ability to monetize its installed base at the same high rates it does in the U.S. and Europe. That assumption is now running into regulatory roadblocks.

* The EU’s Digital Markets Act (2024-2025) will force Apple to allow third-party app stores and alternative payment systems.
* India, South Korea, and Japan are introducing similar measures.
* The DOJ and FTC in the U.S. are escalating scrutiny on Apple’s App Store model.

The App Store has historically operated with 70-80% operating margins, making it one of the most profitable businesses in the world. But if Apple is forced to cut its 30% commission on in-app purchases or allow competing app stores on iOS, that margin could start to shrink.

Investors have priced Apple as if its Services business will continue expanding indefinitely. But they may be underestimating how much of that growth has been built on monopolistic practices that regulators are now actively dismantling.

# Margins Are Peaking, and Buybacks Are Holding Up the Stock—For Now.

Apple’s gross margin hit a record 47% in 2024, thanks to a greater mix of Services revenue and cost efficiencies in hardware production. But the factors that have driven margin expansion over the past decade are starting to reverse.

* Price sensitivity in emerging markets means Apple may have to sell lower-cost iPhones, reducing hardware margins.
* Regulatory risks to the App Store mean Services margins could compress.
* China’s slowing demand threatens Apple’s most profitable international market.

Meanwhile, Apple’s capital return strategy is doing much of the heavy lifting for its stock price. The company generates over $90 billion in free cash flow annually and spends nearly all of it on buybacks, helping to sustain EPS growth even as revenue growth slows. Without buybacks, Apple’s true earnings trajectory would look much less impressive.

# When Does Apple Become a Buy?

Apple is a great business, but at 33x forward earnings, it should be too rich for most investors. I believe it can become a great business at a great price through one of mechanisms:

* Multiple compression below 20x earnings.
* A regulatory overreaction that temporarily depresses the stock beyond actual impact.
* A broad macro selloff that ignores Apple’s cash-generating ability.

Apple is priced as if its growth story will continue uninterrupted. But in emerging markets, competition is tougher, and pricing power is weaker. The Services business, which has carried Apple’s margins, is now facing existential regulatory threats. Buybacks are keeping the stock afloat, but they can only do so much. Apple will still be a great business in five years. But is it a great stock at today’s price? I don't think it is.

1iqg8ow,Proportion of Price momentum to Liquidity,"Stock prices are determined by what buyers and sellers are willing to pay. When a hedge fund enters a stock, the price may spike in the short term due to a surge in bidding. We saw with GameStop that retail investors(gamblers), with enough capital, can also sustain elevated prices.

For example, a few hedge fund managers could inject significant capital into a micro-cap stock (where less money is needed to move the price) in the same time. By executing large bids within a short timeframe, they drive up the stock price. The key issue then becomes liquidity—how easy is it to exit the position once the stock is pumped? And how thin is trade margin( if we bumped the stock, then it will surge for the same amount when we sells it. **For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction**) 

How difficult is it to pull off this kind of specularity? Do you think there's a formula to calculate liquidity, the optimal trade size, and the time required for such a strategy?

2. The 18A process has shown preliminary results that suggest a better performance than the comparable 2nm process from TSMC (albeit this is due to the lower transistor density), thus technologically INTC is breaking even in the realm of high efficiency chips. 

3. Board is doing one shit after the other, but finally there are signs that this is about to change

4. Major pressure by the government for US tech companies to look into switching orders to INTC could be a catalyst for a spike in profitability

While there is no guarantee that any of points 2-4 will work out, if they do we will see the stock price gain upwards of 100% in the next two years. 

If only one out of the 3 turns out to be true, the performance will probably match the market. This still makes INTC a great opportunity right now, and I have personally invested 10% of my net worth into it. Please beware that I might be wrong, since this is not a financial advice, but rather my humble opinion.

1iq3s4q,How Musk is using TSLA as a piggy bank,"Everyone knows it is a meme stock. By definition it would crash at some point. The trick is to make money while not ending up being the bag holder when it crashes.

But the stock won’t crash unless Musk starts selling. And he knows it too. So he is using the meme stock and meme coins as collateral to invest in real companies that actually have some realistic valuation. 

Musk sold $8.5 billion in Tesla shares to buy Twitter. The stock went down. He basically converted the meme stock to a real company. The banks underwrote that investment suffered losses but he used Twitter to buy the presidency. The banks lost money but gained favors like less regulations instead. Everyone is happy.

He contracts out TSLA stuff to his private companies like xAi.  XAi and Optimus have huge conflicts of interest. Both of them need the best AI talents. My guess is Optimus will end up being the hardware side of the business(nuts and bolts assembly) while the software and IPs will belong to XAi. And for every robot sold, there will be a license paid to XAi. If the board removes Musk, the licensing fee will go up making TSLA side of the business virtually worthless.

I am pretty sure the big investment banks know these things but they are given investment opportunities in his private businesses in exchange for their silence and their inflated analyst valuations. And they don’t want to shoot themselves in the foot having lent him huge sums of money.

People say Musk won’t let TSLA down because most of his wealth is tied to it. At this point he is milking TSLA for what it is worth. He is borrowing against inflated meme stock prices to buy real companies that are private. He is hedging against the inevitable TSLA crash. His lenders are going with the Ponzi scheme to mitigate the risk to their massive investment. Having borrowed heavily against TSLA shares Musk has no incentive to work for TSLA anymore.

If I have sizable TSLA holdings I would be nervously watching his latest  and totally random OpenAI cash offer of $98 billion or a potential tik tok bid. That means the stock will crater again if he sells stock, he may not care because by now he knows the game is up. Maybe it is triggered by BYD offering free FSD on 20k cars. And this time there might be no coming back. He might offer you first dibs on SpaceX ipo for holding worthless TSLA shares but it sure won’t be cheap.

Disclosure: I don’t have any positions on TSLA at this point.

1ipy9ro,Healthcare looks weak.,"Just looking at Novo and now Eli Lilly bordering on going down. 
Why Healthcare Stocks Will Face Pressure Now & in the Near Future:
1. Federal Funding Cuts - Reduced government support for medical research and drug development will hurt pharmaceutical and biotech companies. (Trump administration)
2. Regulatory & Policy Risks - Possible stricter price controls and budget cuts in healthcare sectors, especially with political shifts.
3. Earnings & Growth Concerns - Major healthcare companies (e.g., Biogen, Merck) have reported disappointing earnings and weak future outlooks.
4. Sector Underperformance -
Healthcare stocks lagged behind the S&P 500 in 2024 and may continue to struggle as investors shift toward tech and Al.

1ipvkf6,Are non-dividend stocks zero sum?,"Would like some understanding on the fundamentals 

My thought process is as follows (again, only considering non-dividend stocks): 

The only thing moving the needle is speculation. If AAPL made 1bil more than expected, the stock doesn’t move until the information is available and people start speciation whether it’s good to buy/sell this information. 

Since all the money is just a pooled from the traders, it’s zero sum? It’s not a zero sum wager (winning from another’s loss) but it certainly sounds like zero sum 

Say a stock has 10 investors each having $100 invested. The moment 1/2 of them cash out, the other 1/2 would be left with $50 each, cuz money got taken from the pool and no new money came in

1iprnuo,How I Pick Stocks. Anyone Else?,"For stock selection I just look at charts: going up is good, going down is bad. Add in that you've at least heard of the company. And that it's relatively big.  

Walmart is my benchmark these days.  Have a look at its [1-year & 5-year charts](https://imgur.com/a/gHcW2K8).  Up and to the right.  And smooth.  That's my kind of stock.  

How do you find them?  By looking at a bunch of charts.  Just qualitatively, like a 5th grader would.  Is it going up, and is it smooth over, say, a year?

One way to find them is to look at the best-performing S&P500 sectors, then find the best-performing stocks within those sectors.  

If you don't know of a way to do that, here's one:  
Go to Barchart.com.  
Click on ""Stocks"" at the upper left.  
In the dropdown, far right column, under Sectors, click ""Stock Market Sectors.""  
Sort of in the upper left, in the dropdown box, change ""Today"" to ""1-year.""  
The top sector is ""Communication Services,"" up 35.2% over the last year. Click on it.  
Scroll down the page until you see the list of stock symbols.  
At the upper right of that list in blue it says ""flipcharts."" Click it.   
You might need a free membership, so sign up for that.  

Now click ""flipcharts,"" and you're looking at a candlestick 6-month view of one of the 20-odd stocks in that group.  
Upper left, change the time frame to 1Y.  
Upper right, change Template to Line Chart, Percent.  
(I don't like the candlestick view, but keep that if you want.)  

Now, *finally*, you have some charts to flip through. Only about 20, shouldn't take you more than 5 minutes your first time. You can click to the next chart at the upper right, or use the right arrow on your keyboard.  

You're just looking for charts that look like Walmart's, up and pretty smooth.  

Here's my take on the ones there today:  

CHTR, no. CMCSA, no. DIS jumped a lot in November, but isn't going up. EA, no.  

**FOX**, boom! That's what we're looking for.  
And FOXA (I don't know the difference.)  

GOOG is sort of okay, but I don't like those 3 big drops.  
LYV I mostly like.  
META seems to be taking off.  
NFLX maybe, but that big drop is scary.  
Same with T (though I got in it November 11th, and still in).  
TMUS that big drop is scary, but man, it's almost straight up since then. I'll probably get some of it Monday.  

That's it. We looked at 22 charts. When you get used to it you'll do that in 2 or 3 minutes. Note the ones you like, then study them more after this initial scan.  

That's really all there is to it. You're buying into strength, riding the trend up. But keep an eye on them, and when they start leveling off, find other ones to replace them.  

And this was just one of the S&P 500 Market Sectors. Other sectors are doing well too: Financials, Utilities, Consumer Discretionary, IT.  So scan those charts and see what you like.  

This is just finding the best-performing sectors, and then the best-performing stocks within that sector. It's very powerful.  

Anyone else pick stocks like this?  
If not, give it a try and see what you think.

Criteria for Inclusion in the S&P 500

A company must meet the following criteria to be selected by the Index Committee and be included in the S&P 500 index:

The company should be from the U.S. 

Its market cap must be at least $18 billion. Coin have more than 50 billion market cap  


Its shares must be highly liquid. Coin have 10-20 million shares in average trading volume 

At least 10% of its outstanding shares must be available for public trading. Coinbase public float is around 20-30% 

It must report positive earnings in the most recent quarter.

# ""Stablecoins and blockchain rewards

Coinbase also posted significant revenue from stablecoins and blockchain rewards.

The crypto exchange has a revenue-sharing agreement with Circle, the issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Circle backs its stablecoins with U.S. Treasuries and pockets the interest it earns from holding U.S. debt. Coinbase reported that it had generated $225 million from its deal with Circle in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

The crypto exchange also reported almost $215 million in revenue from “blockchain rewards.” This refers to the money Coinbase earns through staking, or when companies or individuals put crypto they own into escrow to secure a blockchain. In return for locking up their crypto, stakers receive interest. 

In Coinbase’s case, that interest from staking represented almost 10% of its fourth-quarter returns.Stablecoins and blockchain rewards  
""

\---------------------------------

My understanding is that if i own the crypto, i stake it and i get the reward. So, is it same for coinbase ? does it own crypto and stake it ? Or is it simply taking the crypto in its centralized exchanges (which means crypto owned by others/users) staking it and earning rewards for itself - that would be crazy as users should get it instead, isn't it? or can someone who understands it explain it ?

A good majority of people (Americans at least) just call it quits on teeth after years of neglect and/or not understanding the impact our high sugar diets have on them. I personally have just opted to have a few teeth pulled as the cost for keeping them didn't make sense. As a middle class American this is pretty par for course. We love our teeth but the math just doesn't make sense. 

My interest here is two fold. The majority of my country goes almost our entire beginning years of life (lets say upwards to 20 years old) almost completely neglecting our dental health. By the time we start focusing on it we're basically screwed. I also don't see a big focus on this industry by anyone for whatever reason. I think the lack of this interest will lead to tremendous gains for the few investors that put money into the small amount of companies focused on tooth regeneration.

1ipj4xd,TSMC Considers Running Intel’s US Factories After Trump Team Request,">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is considering taking a controlling stake in Intel Corp.’s factories at the request of Trump administration officials, a person familiar with the matter said, as the president looks to boost American manufacturing and maintain US leadership in critical technologies.

>

>Trump’s team raised the idea of a deal between the two companies in recent meetings with officials from the Taiwanese chipmaker, the person said, and TSMC was receptive. It’s unclear whether Intel is open to a transaction.

>

>The talks are in very early stages, and the exact structure of a potential partnership hasn’t been established. But the intended result would have the world’s largest made-to-order chipmaker fully operating Intel’s US semiconductor factories, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the conversations are private. It also would address concerns about Intel’s deteriorating financial state, which has forced the company to slash jobs and curb its global expansion plans.

>

>The arrangement may involve having major American chip designers take equity stakes, according to the person, along with support from the US government. That means the venture wouldn’t solely be owned by a foreign company. TSMC is the go-to chipmaker for Apple Inc., Nvidia Corp. and other companies developing semiconductors that power AI algorithms.

>

>TSMC and Santa Clara, California-based Intel declined to comment. A White House representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

>

>Intel shares pared losses on Friday after Bloomberg reported on the discussions. The stock was down less than 1% to $24 as 1:56 p.m. in New York after dropping as much as 5.3% earlier in the session.

>

>While Intel has lost a lot of ground to rivals over the last five years, it still manufactures the most widely used components in the personal computer and server industries. And it has the largest and most advanced production network owned by a US-based company. Those factories have taken on vital strategic importance as Washington works to reverse decades of semiconductor manufacturing shifting to Asia.

>

>Under former Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, Intel embarked on an ambitious and expensive plan to restore its chipmaking lead, and the company won $7.9 billion in US government funding to support projects in four states. It’s also secured $3 billion to produce chips for the US military, all of which will be paid out over time as Intel’s plants hit key milestones. The company has received $2.2 billion as of January.

>

>But that effort has so far failed to attract enough outside customers to make the investments worthwhile, particularly at a new site in Ohio. Intel’s own products also are losing market share, adding to the overall squeeze on its finances — just when it needs to spend heavily. Gelsinger was forced out in December after the board lost confidence in his turnaround plans.

>

>Though Intel has reiterated its commitment to investing in US factories — even as it pulls back from efforts abroad — Washington officials have for months been discussing contingency plans. One option favored by some in the Biden administration was a possible deal between Intel and GlobalFoundries Inc., Bloomberg has reported.

>

>That would have married a maker of older-generation chips with Intel’s leading-edge business. But GlobalFoundries walked away from cutting-edge production years ago and doesn’t have the money for an acquisition, so those conversations didn’t progress much past a thought exercise.

>

>Biden officials also floated the possibility of TSMC licensing its manufacturing technology for use at Intel’s facilities, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations. But TSMC wasn’t interested in an arrangement that could ultimately benefit a competitor, the people said. And Biden’s team was generally reluctant to take an active role in deal conversations, according to several people familiar with the situation.

>

>Trump, meanwhile, is not shy about cutting deals — and TSMC, which just held its board meeting in the US for the first time, is eager to maintain good relations with the new president.

>

>Trump has repeatedly accused Taiwan of “stealing” the US chip industry and threatened tariffs on foreign-produced semiconductors. He’s expressed a preference for using those kinds of levies to boost US chipmaking instead of government subsidies — the approach adopted by the US Chips and Science Act. That legislation, passed in 2022, led to TSMC winning $6.6 billion in grants to support three plants in Phoenix.

>

>

>But it was also Trump’s first administration that set out to lure TSMC to the US, and top Trump officials have consistently affirmed their commitment to boosting domestic manufacturing. That’s particularly true for technologies at the heart of the US-China competition.

>

>The US “will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the US with American-designed and manufactured chips,” Vice President JD Vance said during an AI summit in Paris earlier this week.

>

>The fact that TSMC is open to an Intel deal indicates a change in tune from just a few months ago. In October, CEO C.C. Wei had told analysts that his company wasn’t interested in acquiring Intel’s factories.

>

>Asked the same question again in January, Wei didn’t directly answer: “They are our very good customers,” he said. “I like them and they are very important to TSMC’s business also. That all I can say.”

Dell shares jumped to a session high on Friday following a report saying Elon Musk’s startup xAI was getting ready to agree to buy $5 billion in artificial intelligence servers from the hardware maker.

The equipment containing Nvidia’s GB200 graphics processing units would be delivered this year, according to Bloomberg, which cited unnamed sources.

Many data center gear manufacturers have been seeing growth from selling boxes for training and running AI models. Dell said in November that it had $3.6 billion in quarterly AI server order demand. Dell’s total revenue for the quarter ended Nov. 1 totaled $24.37 billion, up 10% year over year.

In December xAI announced a $6 billion funding round. CNBC reported that the Musk startup was raising the money to purchase GPUs. The Grok assistant from xAI is available for people to use on the Musk-owned social network X.

Usually the opposite of whatever the general consensus is, is what actually happens.

1ipf53k,HIMS: 32.94% Short Interest & Earnings on Feb 24 – Squeeze Incoming?,"📈 HIMS: 32.94% Short Interest & Earnings on Feb 24 – Squeeze Incoming?

Hims & Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS) has been on an absolute tear lately, closing at $59.18 after a 27% single-day gain. But what’s really catching my attention is the massive short interest—32.94% of the float is shorted. With earnings coming up on February 24, could we be looking at a potential short squeeze?

🔍 The Setup: Why HIMS Could See More Upside
	•	Short Interest: 32.94% of the float is short—this is extremely high.
	•	Days to Cover: 3.7 days—If a squeeze happens, it could escalate fast.
	•	Momentum is Strong: +27% in a single day means the stock is already attracting buyers.
	•	Earnings on Feb 24: If HIMS beats expectations, shorts could be forced to cover, accelerating an upward move.

This stock has the classic setup for a major move higher if catalysts align.

🛑 Why Are Shorts Betting Against HIMS?

1️⃣ Valuation Concerns – After a big rally, some believe HIMS is overvalued.
2️⃣ Profitability Questions – While revenue growth is strong, it’s still working toward sustained profitability.
3️⃣ Competition – Giants like Amazon and Teladoc are expanding in the space.
4️⃣ Recent Run-Up – Some traders may be expecting a pullback after the massive surge.

However, these same shorts could be fuel for a squeeze if sentiment stays bullish.

🔥 Bullish Case: Could HIMS Hit $100?

🚀 Shorts Are Stuck – If earnings beat expectations, covering could push the stock much higher.
🚀 Retail Interest Is Growing – Increased trading volume could indicate more retail momentum.
🚀 Breakout Levels – If HIMS clears $65-$70, technical traders could pile in.
🚀 Telehealth Growth – Long-term, HIMS is expanding its subscription model and increasing its customer base.

💰 My Position & Dilemma

I currently hold 1,000 shares and am up $52K from an initial $8K investment. Now, I’m debating my next move:
1️⃣ Hold for the potential squeeze?
2️⃣ Take some profits before earnings and reduce risk?
3️⃣ Reinvest into call options for higher leverage?

📊 Final Thoughts – What’s Next for HIMS?

HIMS is one of the highest shorted stocks in the market, has earnings as a major catalyst, and has strong momentum going into the event. If the company delivers strong guidance and beats earnings, we could see $80+ or even $100 in the coming weeks.

💡 What are your thoughts? Are we looking at a real short squeeze setup, or is it time to take profits before earnings?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ipf53k/hims_3294_short_interest_earnings_on_feb_24/,1739552263.0
1ipetzp,Meta plans major investment into AI-powered humanoid robots,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-plans-major-investment-ai-160000083.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-plans-major-investment-ai-160000083.html)

Meta Platforms Inc., after pushing into augmented reality and artificial intelligence, has identified its next big bet: AI-powered humanoid robots.

The company is making a significant investment into the category — futuristic robots that can act like humans and assist with physical tasks — and is forming a new team within its Reality Labs hardware division to conduct the work, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Meta plans to work on its own humanoid robot hardware, with an initial focus on household chores. Its bigger ambition is to make the underlying AI, sensors and software for robots that will be manufactured and sold by a range of companies, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative hasn’t been announced.

Meta has started discussing its plan with robotics companies, including Unitree Robotics and Figure AI Inc. At least initially, it doesn’t plan to build a Meta-branded robot — something that could directly rival Tesla Inc.’s Optimus — but it may consider doing so in the future, the people added.

The humanoid effort mirrors exploratory projects at other technology giants, including Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Deepmind division. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.

Meta confirmed the creation of the new team to employees Friday, telling them it will be led by Marc Whitten, who resigned as chief executive officer of General Motors Co.’s Cruise self-driving car division earlier this month. He was previously an executive at gaming company Unity Software Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.

“The core technologies we’ve already invested in and built across Reality Labs and AI are complementary to developing the advancements needed for robotics,” Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, wrote in a memo reviewed by Bloomberg News. He mentioned the company’s advancements in hand tracking, computing at low bandwidth and always-on sensors.

Meta executives believe that while humanoid robotics companies have made headway in hardware, Meta’s advances in artificial intelligence and data collected from augmented and virtual reality devices could accelerate progress in the nascent industry. Current humanoids are still not useful enough to fold clothes, carry a glass of water, place dishes in a rack for cleaning or conduct other home chores that could get consumers interested in the category.

“We believe that expanding our portfolio to invest in this field will only accrue value to Meta AI and our mixed and augmented reality programs,” Bosworth wrote. Whitten, who will report to Bosworth, will have headcount to hire around 100 engineers this year, one of the people said.

Meta’s goal is to provide what Google’s Android operating system and Qualcomm Inc.’s chips did for the phone industry by building a foundation for the rest of the market.

The software, sensors and computing packages that Meta is already developing for its devices are the same technologies that are needed to power humanoids, according to one of the people involved in the project.

Meta has been investing billions of dollars for years into its Reality Labs hardware division, which sells products like the Quest VR headset and the increasingly popular Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta plans to spend $65 billion this year on related products, including artificial intelligence infrastructure and the new robot work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ipetzp/meta_plans_major_investment_into_aipowered/,1739551461.0

1ipc996,Buying stocks for dividends,"Is it worth it to buy stocks of a company if the stock price is usually stable and no significant price growth can be expected within 5 years? Yes, the trends is for the price to grow, but it may take 5 years to go, for example, from $50 to $52.

My point is, I want to eventually reach a point where I make around $6,000 a year in dividends from a single company that offers 3,5-4% dividends.

The company in question is Shell. The company has diversified investments and is future-proof, stable and well established, so there is no risk of bankruptcy under normal market conditions.

The risk I'm taking, is that dividends could be cut, and there won't be any money coming to me because the stock price grows very slowly.

So, under normal market conditions, in the absence of global pandemics, wars and disruptive events, what could make Shell cut dividends? What usually makes a company to cut dividends under normal market conditions while there is good profitability?

Also, if you think Shell is not a good option, you can recommend me a better company. I'm in the EU, so better recommend me EU-based companies because the US has a witholding tax for foreign investors.

Consumers sharply curtailed their spending in January, indicating a potential weakening in economic growth ahead, according to a Commerce Department report Friday.

Retail sales slipped 0.9% for the month from an upwardly revised 0.7% gain in December, even worse than the Dow Jones estimate for a 0.2% decline. The sales totals are adjusted for seasonality but not inflation for a month in which prices rose 0.5%.


Excluding autos, prices fell 0.4%, also well off the consensus forecast for a 0.3% increase. A “control” measure that strips out several nonessential categories and figures directly into calculations for gross domestic product fell 0.8% after an upwardly revised increase of 0.8%.

With consumer spending making up about two-thirds of all economic activity in the U.S., the sales numbers indicate a potential weakening in growth for the first quarter.

Receipts at sporting goods, music and book stores tumbled 4.6% on the month, while online outlets reported a 1.9% decline and motor vehicles and parts spending dropped 2.8%. Gas stations along with food and drinking establishments both reported 0.9% increases.

# Key Highlights:

* **Transaction revenue:** $1.56B (up **270% QoQ**)
* **Total revenue:** $2.3B (**vs. $1.84B expected**)
* **Earnings per share (EPS):** $4.68 (**vs. $2.11 expected**)
* **Stock performance:** Shares reached a **three-year high** of $349.75 in December and are currently around $304 (+112% YoY).

# Market Drivers:

* Bitcoin surpassed **$100,000** in Q4, contributing to a surge in trading volume.
* Political shifts played a role, as the **reelection of Trump** has led to expectations of a more **favorable regulatory environment** for crypto.
* Coinbase is engaged in an ongoing legal battle with the SEC, but recent court rulings and potential regulatory leadership changes (such as the appointment of **Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto former SEC commissioner**) may signal a shift in policy.

# Beyond Trading Revenue:

While transaction fees remain Coinbase’s primary revenue driver, the company is expanding its **subscription and services segment**, particularly through **USDC stablecoin reserves**.

* **USDC revenue:** $226M (down slightly from $246M QoQ, but up from $172M YoY).
* Coinbase holds an **equity stake in Circle** and is working to expand USDC’s market share.
* Current USDC market cap: **$56B** (compared to Tether’s **$142B**).

# Looking Ahead:

* **Can Coinbase sustain this momentum?** While Q4 revenue was up **141% YoY**, it remains below the **2021 peak of $2.5B in Q4** during the last major bull run.
* **Regulatory clarity** could be a major factor in long-term performance. The SEC’s stance on crypto has been a headwind, but new leadership and recent legal challenges could alter the landscape.
* **Valuation concerns:** With COIN’s stock up over **100% YoY**, some investors may see it as overextended. Others argue that increased crypto adoption and improved regulatory certainty could justify further upside.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1ip48s8,Can the politicians threaten the short sellers to stay away for now else they will be put in a corner with rules against shorting?,"Below is just my speculation. See if there is any hole in this theory. 

Please Note:I like short sellers, they keep us honest else we will be blowing bubbles all the time. They are very important aspect of the financial markets.

Right now the new govt(USA) is doing lots of big changes including weekly tariff dramas. If the market was to go down right now it will be a very bad look. The admin is close with big wall street folks. Simple message to hedge funds is to not short the market until all clear is given.

The govt along with SEC has huge powers to make short sellers life hell, like banning short selling or causing squeeze with positive announcements. Blaming short sellers for economic crisis and congressional hearings can be nightmare too. So, IMO, if the govt tells wall street to not short big time, they will definitely listen.

So, IMO, market going down due to hedge funds shorting bit time is a low probability.

That said, market can go down due to numerous other factors, which are not known at the moment, but this time around hedge funds will not aggravate the situations by piling on and sending stock big time down. Which means we may get 4-5% down and then markets will recover due to dip buying.

That means, we can all relax and ride this train as far as it wants to go. Valuations does not matter if people are buying automatically every month(payroll) and current owners like me are happy with our holding until the story changes.

That said, I will be shocked if markets are 15% higher at the end of the year because I am not expecting EPS to increase that much by then(SPY TTM EPS is still below 2021 peak, but we are 25% higher).",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ip48s8/can_the_politicians_threaten_the_short_sellers_to/,1739513734.0
1ip2deq,Airbnb shares pop 15% on better-than-expected earnings and revenue,"Airbnb shares jumped 15% in extended trading on Thursday after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analysts’ estimates.

Here’s how the company did compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 73 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $2.48 billion vs. $2.42 billion expected

Revenue increased 12% from $2.22 billion during the same period last year. Airbnb reported net income of $461 million, or 73 cents per share. A year ago, Airbnb reported a loss of $349 million, or a loss of 55 cents per share.

In the first quarter, Airbnb expects to report revenue between $2.23 billion and $2.27 billion. Analysts were expecting $2.3 billion for the period, according to LSEG. Airbnb said its first quarter of 2024 benefited from both Easter and an extra day in February.

Airbnb also said adjusted profit for the fourth quarter was $765 million, up 4% year over year. Analysts were expecting $653.5 million, according to StreetAccount.

In a letter to shareholders, the company said it has rebuilt its technology stack and rolled out new product updates in recent years that are driving higher conversion rates. The company also teased new offerings that it will launch in May, though it did not disclose additional details. 

“Airbnb is a fundamentally stronger company today than it was several years ago,” the letter said. “We’re continuing to build on this momentum in 2025, executing a multi-year strategy to perfect the core service, accelerate growth in global markets, and launch and scale new offerings.”

The company reported 111 million nights and experiences booked, up 12% from a year ago and above the 108.7 million expected by StreetAccount. Gross booking value, which Airbnb uses to report host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $17.6 billion in the fourth quarter. That is above the $17.2 billion expected by analysts polled by StreetAccount.

Airbnb said Airbnb.org, a nonprofit founded by the company, has housed more than 19,000 people and 2,300 pets following the devastating wildfires that broke out in Los Angeles last month. The nonprofit has pledged to offer 100,000 free nights and has received $27 million in donations, including $18 million from Airbnb and its founders.

The company said it has more than five million hosts and eight million active listings around the world. Average daily rates increased 1% from a year ago to $158 in the fourth quarter, the company said.

Airbnb shares were up about 7% for the year before Thursday’s report, topping the Nasdaq, which has gained more than 3%.

1iotkrl,Buy/Sell/Hold SPOT - Is it overvalued?,"I've been bullish on SPOT for years, started buying at $73 in 2022 and DCA'd up to a cost basis of $120, so I've done well so far but is my original thesis playing out and still intact?

**OG Thesis:**

My original thesis, shortened so we can focus on today and the future: The majority of Spotify users are ad tier (at the time around 60%), but they made up less than 15% of revenue. Spotify was focused on growing MAUs instead of real monetization, but once the MAU growth starts to slow they will pivot more into monetization. I'm not concerned about more ads scaring away users, some will go to Subscriber tier and the others weren't profitable anyway, since Spotify's expenses are somewhat tied to how many listens they get having less listeners that aren't profitable isn't necessarily bad. Additionally, Spotify started getting into podcasts and I saw that being a driver of future growth. Lastly, I think they have pricing power on subscriptions. 



**Past Performance:**

So how has Spotify done over the last 2 years (from Q2 22 to Q4 24)?

|\#'s in Thousands|Q2 2022|Q4 2024|Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|MAUs|433|678|54.3%|
|Revenue|2,864|4,242|48.1%|
|Net Income|(125)|367|393.6%|
|Free Cash flow|37|877|2,270.3%|

Key factors tying to my thesis: 2022 Ad tier MAU was 59.12% and contributed to 12.52% of revenue. In 2024 it was 62.96% and 12.66% respectively.

  
My thoughts based on my original thesis: I did expect Ad tier MAU to begin to contribute more to revenue by now, especially with being an even larger percent of MAU. I like to invest thinking 5 years ahead minimum, so at the time I was thinking by 2027 Ad tier should contribute to 30% of revenue (while maintaining around the 60% of MAU area), there is time left for them to get to the 30% area I wanted to see but I did expect to see SOME improvement. Spotify is also still growing MAU at >10% so I will give some slack in not fully monetizing yet. Spotify has done 2-3 Sub tier price increases with another one announced, so I was right they have pricing power (I wish they used it more on ad tier than loyal Subscribers tho). I am happy with their podcast growth, thankful they realized to cut their podcast spending though. 

  
Overall thoughts: Clearly Spotify figured out the cost cutting and improved FCF and net income at a very healthy clip. I'm also generally happy with the MAU growth but slightly disappointed in Revenue growth. Back to the Ad tier not carrying their weight there. I'm also very pleased with the introduction of audiobooks and video integration. Both I think can be growth drivers with video having huge potential. Personally, as a user, I think they are pricing audiobooks too aggressively for it to do as well as it can.

  
**Spotify's future:**

I did my own rough estimates for their MAU, revenue, and FCF in 10 years. Then I did an estimate using Spotify's target 1B MAU by 2030 and expanding growth another 5 years.

My method:

I used 4%/yr MAU growth (Subs growing 6% and Ad 2.5%). I won't bore you with too much info, but I made 6 revenue estimates using varying growth of Rev/MAU for Ad and Sub tier. Then I estimated each estimates FCF using 15% (current rate), 20% and 25%. 

**M1**

|In thousands|Minimum Estimate|Max Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Revenue**|29,028|92,227|
|**Free Cash Flow**|5,854|23,057|

  
Now using Spotifys estimate of 1B MAU by 2030 then 5%/yr to 2035. I used the same method for revenue and FCF estimates.

**M2**

|In thousands|Minimum Estimate|Max Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Revenue**|47,964|118,578|
|**Free Cash Flow**|7,195|29,681|

 My minimum revenue estimates used 3%/yr growth rev/MAU for both Ad and Sub tier. My max uses 8% for subs and 31% for ad tier BUT with a 10% cut to ad tier MAU to account for upset users. Figures based on average yearly revenue per user, See below:

|Tier|FY 2024 Average|Minimum Estimate|Max Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Ad|56|75|120|
|Subscriber|5|7|75|

  
**Valuation:**

I like reverse DCF calcs to find what todays valuation should be. For my estimates I used 4% terminal growth and 11% Discount rate. For estimates with Spotify MAU growth I used 3% terminal and 11% Discount rate, with the faster growth I expect less runway for the terminal growth. I will show my RDCF valuations for the Average and Max FCF estimates, not the minimum since it is absolutely overvalued if it doesn't surpass min estimates. 

Price today: **$647.66**

|Average M1|Max M1|Average M2|Max M2|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|548.26|841.90|638.41|958.93|
|(15.35%)|30.50%|\-1.13%|48.17%|



**Final Thoughts:**

As the valuations show, Spotify has upside if they surpass some pretty hefty targets. But even hitting my average estimates doesn't give much upside at the current price, M2 average assumes 23.5% FCF growth for 10 yrs which is no joke. I'm still bullish on the company, but I'm **Holding** for now with buying as an option on a 12%+ dip from current prices. 

**Thesis going forward:**

My original thesis is mostly still in play. I see a future where monetizing the ad tier can lead to significant growth.  Podcasts, audiobooks and video have huge potential and can drive growth the hit my highest estimates. Podcasts and audiobooks gives support to price increases and better advertising opportunities while also having higher potential margins due to less royalties. Video can drive more streaming hours and grab some market share from Youtube or other streamers. Spotify is integrating it slowly and they didn't mention tapping into a youtube-like video platform but if they can successfully pull it off any market share gain will lead to better than expected growth. 

For me to buy more I will like to see video progress and/or higher ad RPU or achieving 15%+ Subscriber growth. At current valuations I don't see a way to justify the valuation with less than 25% of revenue coming from Ad tier. It just isn't sustainable to raise subscription prices enough to justify the valuation, which is why 15%+ growth here could sway me to buy.

Selling would involve losing MAU without significantly increasing ad tier RPU, stagnant MAU and RPU growth, or ad tier growing higher than 65% without contributing more than 15% of revenue. I'd probably sell some if it increases above $730, it'd be my first 10-bagger and over-priced for me. So I'd want to lock in that kind of gain and buy again at a better valuation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iotkrl/buysellhold_spot_is_it_overvalued/,1739480784.0

1iorw0f,I’m continuing to hedge against an economic downturn,"Without going into politics to the greatest extent possible, there seem to be a number of economic headwinds coming this year. Inflation is persisting, and rates are looking less likely to get cut. A number of major employers have went through rounds of layoffs. Tariffs threaten to increase prices and compress margins further. And war in the Middle East looks to be picking up steam instead of winding down. 


Between how hot the market has been and all of the volatility that appears ahead, I’ve continued my strategy of pruning investments and selling covered calls on select positions. Today I sold a covered call on VOO with a strike of $615 and expiration of 01/26. My VOO is up 20% in less than a year and getting to the strike would be an additional 10% gain. 


I’m not suggesting this is the right move for everyone, but as I weigh my risk tolerance against my uncertainty in the market stability and U.S. economy, I feel more comfortable repositioning and reducing some of my exposure.


Wanted to put that out there and get responses from the community on what you expect for 2025 and how you’re positioning. 



Edit: to clear up some repeating comments



If you are reading politics into this post, that is 100% on you. We’re here to talk about the market, so be mature and try to do just that 



I do not think I’m Michael Burry. I’m not trying to beat the market, or time the market. I am actually trying to remove any element of timing by ensuring I am liquid enough to last through worst case scenario without touching my portfolio should the market take a big hit.



I’m in a position where I don’t have to touch my taxable brokerage. To ensure I can keep it that way should serious economic downturn hit, I have locked in profits to build my cash position. I’ve done this both by selling certain profitable positions and by selling CCs on profitable positions. The point of selling CCs is to lock in profit, nothing more. Yes this caps upside. That is ok



No matter what the market does, I continue contributing to my retirement accounts. If the market keeps running, good for my retirement. If it crashes, I’m prepared. This is how I handle my risk tolerance, by balancing what I leave in equities with what I have in cash



Edit 2: I’m happy to see different opinions and value everyone expressing their strategies and what they think makes sense for their portfolios. It’s why I post here. But some of you get really emotional in these comments. We can be adults and discuss different opinions without getting upset or resorting to childish name calling.

1iopt8y,iPhone SE 4: Apple Confirms New Product Launch Date Just Days Away,"

Apple has confirmed a new product launch for Wednesday, February 19, with CEO Tim Cook posting a cryptic teaser on X: “Get ready to meet the newest member of the family.” While Apple hasn’t explicitly mentioned the iPhone SE 4, speculation is strong that this will be the long-awaited update to the SE lineup, last refreshed in 2022. The teaser featured an Apple logo with a liquid metal look, which some believe could hint at another product like an iPad or MacBook, but industry insiders are confident it’s the new iPhone.

If the iPhone SE 4 is indeed the product being unveiled, Apple is expected to follow its typical launch schedule. Pre-orders will likely start on Friday, February 21, with reviews appearing around February 26 or 27 once the media embargo lifts. The official release is predicted for Friday, February 28, when customers will be able to purchase the device in stores and online. While details about the phone’s name, design, and pricing remain unconfirmed, Apple is expected to reveal everything through an announcement on its Newsroom website rather than a live event.

This timeline aligns with earlier leaks from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who initially predicted the SE 4 would launch this week before revising his estimate. While Apple’s teaser leaves room for speculation, the consensus is that an affordable iPhone refresh is imminent, bringing a new option for budget-conscious users who want Apple’s latest technology at a lower price point. More details will emerge soon, and if anything changes, updates are expected to follow.

**Technicals:** Nothing to do but wait until 1 PM.

**Catalyst:** Trump said that he promises reciprocal tariffs today. This will likely be on China because they are the only country left of the three (Canada/Mexico). He stated he'll give details at 1 PM on Truth Social.

**Risks:** More volatility near that time, going to position accordingly depending on the context of the tweet, but likely will be trading VXX unless something very context specific.

**Ticker:** [**DDOG (Datadog, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DDOG&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Earnings with an EPS of $0.49 vs. $0.43 expected. Revenue of $738M vs. $714.5M expected.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in this unless we break $130 after the open.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Cloud security sector is overall growing due to enterprise adoption, but DDOG cited $3.185B vs $3.24B of revenue guidance, slightly lower than expected.

**Risks:** More tariffs, rising/flat interest rates when we expected them to be cut, mostly macro factors when faced with more technology spending.

**Related Tickers:** S, CRWD

**Ticker:** [**BIDU (Baidu, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BIDU&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Baidu announced that its AI chatbot, Ernie Bot, will be available for free starting April 1, citing advancements in technology and reduced costs.

**Technicals:** Had a decent spike premarket, will be watching if this breaks $100 or not.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** AI is getting cheaper and cheaper; this is a decision similar to DeepSeek to attract users. Will be testing capabilities personally to see how it goes. These competitors are rising to meet OpenAI mainly in price, (can you really get better than free?) and are content with being ""second-best"" as long as customers can save in price and they can save in training costs. Ultimately, I see it as a viable strategy because the average white-collar worker doesn't need the highest performing LLMs.

**Ticker:** [**HOOD (Robinhood Markets, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)

**Catalyst:** HOOD reported EPS of $1.01 vs 0.44. Revenue reached $1.01B vs $934M.

**Technicals:** Overall a blowout, watching the $65 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Resurgence in retail trading activity, particularly in cryptocurrencies. Also cited election betting as a major revenue factor. Also announced three major events - new advisory features, crypto events, and the 'HOOD Summit' from the past.

**Risks:** The company's growth is mainly being driven by crypto, which may be curbed by the SEC (but Gensler is gone so I doubt it).

**Related Tickers:** COIN (also has earnings today!)

**Ticker:** [**RDDT (Reddit)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RDDT&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reddit reported EPS of $0.36 vs $0.25. Revenue reached $427.7M, vs 408.9M.

**Technicals:** Overall the earnings were good - I have no idea why it fell. Also seems like the market agrees; it's recovered some of the move. The only thing I can find was Reddit's daily active users was 101.7M, slightly below expectations of 103.24M.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Reddit cited that their Trends Feature has significant interest from advertisers, but beyond that still not 100% sure as to why the drop.

1iojaoh,Apple’s Stock-Market Performance Is Increasingly Made in China,"* Country is both a significant market and key production hub
* Apple has underperformed other Big Tech stocks this year

>Investors in America’s biggest company are increasingly focused on China, where Apple Inc. is striving to win over a crucial customer base while also facing tariff-related risks.

>The iPhone maker counts China as a significant market and a major manufacturing hub. If it improves its flagging sales in the country with artificial intelligence features in its devices, that could be a key catalyst to revive the investment case. On the other hand, tariffs and the prospect of an escalating trade war represent risks of unknown magnitude.

>Read: Apple’s China Focus Thrusts It Into Center of Geopolitical Fight

>“Apple’s level of exposure to China is a risk relative to much of the rest of the market,” said Matt Stucky, chief equity portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. The prospect of Apple being in the crosshairs of tariffs or investigations should be on investors’ radars, he said.

>“However, if AI iPhones are a success, that could mean steady growth over the next several years,” he added.

>The shares are down 5.4% in 2025, making Apple the worst performer among the Magnificent 7 except for Tesla Inc. Sentiment has soured in recent months, with tepid demand for the iPhone 16 — the first to incorporate AI features — and tariff risks weighing. The company’s recent results were mixed, featuring disappointing China and iPhone sales, though the forecast was seen as encouraging.

>Improving China sales would be significant. Apple got about 17% of its fiscal 2024 revenue from the greater China region, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, compared with about 26% for Europe and more than 40% for the Americas.

>The potential for improved trends in China was demonstrated this week, when Apple jumped on a broadly negative day for markets following a report that it has started working with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to bring AI features to Apple products in China. The Chinese firm’s chairman confirmed the partnership on Thursday.

>“We would view this as a critical catalyst for Apple’s competitive standing in China,” Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote earlier this week. Citing a survey the firm conducted, he added that Chinese iPhone users are more interested in AI than US or European peers, and that more than 50% said the staggered roll out of Apple Intelligence had “a moderate to significant impact on their decision not to upgrade to a new iPhone this cycle.”

>Any improvement would also come after a period of muted growth compared with Big Tech peers. Apple’s revenue has fallen in five of the past nine quarters, and while analysts expect 4.9% growth in fiscal 2025, this is less than half the 11.6% pace expected for the overall tech sector, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

>Within this context, geopolitical tensions loom large. The Trump administration imposed 10% tariffs against China, and the country retaliated with tariffs of its own. China is also weighing a potential probe into Apple’s policies and App Store fees.

>Analysts are so far downplaying the risk of tariffs, though they note uncertainties like how long they might be in place and whether Apple will get an exemption. Evercore ISI sees an impact “in the range of 3-4% of EPS,” which it described as “relatively minimal.” Bank of America said the impact on earnings should be “limited” and “manageable.”

>Still, Apple’s valuation suggests limited room for error. Shares trade at 31 times estimated earnings, roughly 50% above their average over the past decade. The stock also trades at a premium to the broader market and the overall tech sector.

>Following multiple downgrades this year, just over 60% of analysts recommend buying the stock, a rate well below megacaps like Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., or Meta Platforms Inc.

>Still, investors continue to view Apple as a relatively defensive stock given its strong cash flow, massive buyback program, high-margin services business, and a lack of heavy spending on AI.

>“Apple looks a little problematic in the short term given the valuation and the lack of growth, but you’re not going to find a more impressive cash-cow of a company,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services. “There’s a reason it remains an institutional and retail favorite.”

1iog7em,NIKE is still overvalued,"I have seen Nike being considered/favoured by various people on Reddit and in real life over the last year after the stock price has continued to fall. 

Would anyone care to defend Nike? I have the following thoughts: 

They are making an EBIT of 5-7bn yearly and a FCF of 4-6bn, with 12bn total debt (good, not too high) and a market cap of 107bn. Dividend yield is 2.08%. 

The financials indicate that revenue has peaked. And let's be honest, the market is already saturated. They are only really able to grow organically in emerging markets, or through raising prices. So there's barely an assumption of growth built into the revenue/profit/FCF. 

So why pay 107/6 = ~18x FCF/profit? They could increase margins if they significantly lowered advertising, but I don't think that's going to happen because without advertising you have a dead brand. 

I looked at Nike because it was recommended as a good dividend paying stock with growth potential, but I am only seeing a small dividend and overpriced valuation. If the dividend yield were 4% (market cap 56bn I.e. share price $40) I would say it is a good buy. 

So do you disagree, and why?  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iog7em/nike_is_still_overvalued/,1739442681.0

1ioeax0,"Sony Group Raises Earnings Guidance on Strength in Game, Music Businesses","- For the fiscal year ending March, it now projects that net profit to climb 11%

Sony Group raised its annual earnings projections after reporting a rise in third-quarter net profit thanks to the strength in its game and music businesses.

The Japanese entertainment and electronics company said Thursday that net profit increased 2.7% from a year earlier to 373.74 billion yen, equivalent to $2.42 billion, for the three months ended December. That beat the estimate of Y290.5 billion in a poll of analysts by data provider Visible Alpha.

Third-quarter revenue grew 18% to Y4.410 trillion.

For the year ending March, it now projects net profit to climb 11% to Y1.080 trillion and revenue to increase 1.4% to Y13.200 trillion. It previously projected Y980.00 billion in net profit and Y12.710 trillion in revenue.

Sony raised its full-year operating profit forecast for its game business to Y380.0 billion from Y355.0 billion projected earlier. It also increased its annual operating profit view for its music business, expecting Y340.0 billion instead of Y330.0 billion forecast previously.

Third-quarter operating profit from its game business rose 37% to Y118.06 billion. Operating profit from its music business climbed 28% to Y97.42 billion.

Yes robotics and artificial intelligence are EVOLVING and will increase the productivity of companies.

1io5au6,I researched a company for the first time and thought I would share my DD on the company here. Here is a DD on $SERV.,"I decided to research the company Serve Robotics. This is my first time delving into a company's 10-k and other press releases to understand the company. I thought I would share it here to get some feedback on how I did and what I should improve on. I didn't read the entire 10-k but did read enough to get an understanding of what the company does and what catalysts I should look out for. I would appreciate any feedback on this due diligence.

**Business:**

Serve Robotics sells a last mile delivery service via a robot. This robot is a sidewalk robot that goes to a restaurant, a restaurant employee puts the food in the robot's container and the robot travels on sidewalks to deliver the food to the relevant address.

This service is provided on the Uber Eats app as Uber holds a minority stake in Serv Robotics because Serve Robotics is a spin off from Uber. The project was originally started in the company Postmates and later became a part of Uber when Uber bought Postmates. Nvdia is also a strategic partner in this company.

The company also sells ad space on its robot. Advertisements are run on the robots body. The company is also potentially looking into selling fleets of its robots to corporations that might have a use for them. There is no contract or sale of a fleet as of now. These robots can also be used for other last mile deliveries such as parcels. At the moment, these robots only do food deliveries and run ads. These are their main sources of revenue.

The motivation behind these robots comes from the data that more than 50 percent of deliveries are within 2.5 miles from a restaurant. These robots are useful to food delivery companies as it should help them cut costs in deliveries.

The robot can travel as fast as 7 miles/hr and has a range of 37 miles. A robot averages 20-40 deliveries a day. The robot's container can hold up to 2 big bags or four large pizzas. The container is sealed and is opened via the Uber Eats app or a code that can be typed on the screen on the robot. The robot constantly provides its current location through the app. The robots go back to a hub at night and take a few hours to charge. The robot can navigate terrain by itself 80 percent of the time and requires manual control 20 percent of the time. A person manually controlling a robot can operate up to 4 robots at a time. The percentage of self navigation a robot can handle is expected to increase with new advancements in Artificial Intelligence. There is also a technician that would drive to a robot in case it needs to be fixed or brought back to a charging station. This situation hasn't been a problem that often so far.

The company had a pilot with Uber that it passed and has a contract to produce 2000 robots by the end of 2025 and have them operational on the platform.

The company has 59 daily active robots as of the quarter ending on September 30, 2024. The daily supply hours that the robots provide are 465. This comes out to 7.8 hours a day per robot.

The company rolled out their third generation robots on October 16, 2024. These robots can reach speeds roughly twice as fast, travel roughly twice as far on a single charge and spend 6 more hours in the field. The company also managed to cut the cost of producing one robot by half. The robots storage also increased by 15 percent.

**Revenue:**

In the year ending on 31 December, 2022, the company made $108,819 in revenue and in the year ending on 31 December 2023, the company made $207,545 in revenue.

In the year ending on 31 December, 2022, the company had a net loss of $21,855,127 and in the year ending on 31 December, 2023, the company had a net loss of $24,813,736.

The company has since gone to put more robots out on the field and revenue increased in subsequent quarters. The constituents of the revenue of these quarters isn't expected to stay the same. Explanation given after the numbers. The following are the numbers for the quarters ending on

March 31, 2024         - 39 daily active robots and $946,711 in revenue.

June 30, 2024           - 48 daily active robots and $468,375 in revenue.

September 30, 2024 - 59 daily active robots and $221,555 in revenue.

A big part of the revenue for the first two quarters comes from Serve Robotics providing non-exclusive software services to Magna. Magna is the company that they are using to build their fleet of 2000 robots. The software services provided were some non exclusive software that Serve made for their robots. This benefits Magna as they can use this information to produce better products.

The three quarters had $851,101, $296,035 and $38,767 in revenue respectively, from these software services provided to Magna. These numbers are not expected to go up or be a constant source of revenue.

**Future earnings guidance**: With the deployment of the 2000 robots, they are estimating their yearly run rate revenue to increase up to 60 - 80 million dollars.

**Challenges:**

The biggest challenge this company faces is the cost to produce and run the robot. Before they announced their third generation of robots, it cost $63,000 to produce a robot. They have managed to cut that cost in half.

They expect a robot to last 5-6 years. At its previous cost of $63,000, it would take one robot 4 years just to make back the amount of money put into it before the robot is not fit for service anymore. With the new cost, this number has gone down to 2 years and gives the robot more time to produce a profit. The numbers are as follows. I have picked their last quarters numbers to do this calculation. They had 59 daily active robots. Their revenue from deliveries was $112,288 and revenue from branding fees(fees they charge to run ad's) was $70,500. Their total revenue for 59 robots was $221,555. That comes out to $3755 per robot for one quarter. At their previous cost of $63,000, it would take the robot 16 quarters or 4 years to make back the money it cost to produce them. Because they have managed to cut costs by half(I am using $32,000 as a conservative estimate), it would now take them 8 quarters or 2 years to make back the money it cost to produce one robot.

These calculations don't take into account the running costs of the robots. These are the other challenges the company faces in turning a profit.

I couldn't find any numbers on how much they have to pay for their remote operators and technicians. I did email investor relations asking the following questions.

1. Has the ratio of remote operators to robots decreased? As in, can one remote operator handle more than 4 robots or not?
2. How much does it cost to have one remote operator per x many robots(whatever data they might have for x) and how much does it cost to have a field technician and if they have any data on the ratio of technician to robots.
3. Are the remote operators in America? If so, are there any plans to have these operators in countries where labour is cheap.

They haven't gotten back to me yet. I will update this post when they do.

**Catalysts to look for:**

The biggest catalysts to look for is if they can reduce their cost of producing a robot further and if they can reduce their costs of running a robot more. These two things will help tremendously in them turning a profit from these robots.

The other catalyst to look for is advancements in AI and the decrease in hardware prices. Their robots are at level 4 autonomy and with more advancements in AI, they can bring their robots to level 5. If this were to happen, the robots would require less operators and technicians. With decreases in hardware prices, it would be cheaper for them to produce their robots.

I still have to more research on what exactly are the most important and most expensive parts needed to produce their robots. They do say that a LIDAR component is very important in the production of their robots. I don't know much about this component yet but will do more research into it.

**My comments on the stock:**

This stock is definitely very speculative. I am looking forward to their next earnings and their next 10-k, both of which are near the end of this month. I think there is potential in this company if they can manage to bring down their cost of production and running costs.

I still have to do more research and understand their financials more. They have managed to raise more money and as of September 30, 2024 they had $50.9 million in cash or cash equivalent.

The stock is trading at a market cap of roughly $1 billion dollars. I do believe that the stock is priced with high expectations for its future profitability.

1io3txt,Confluent Is At An Inflection Point,"**Confluent (CFLT) $37 is still worth buying.** 

I’ve owned it for over two years but will pyramid (add smaller quantities on a large base) it further.

**Why is this company still worth investing in after a 20% post-earning bump?**

**Four important catalysts**

**Databricks partnership:** The partnership with Databricka, which is much better known and valued increases brand awareness and opens a lot of new opportunities and doors.

This could accelerate growth from the current 22-23%.

**Strong customer base:** 90% of its revenues come from 100K + ARR clients.

The $1Mn+cohort in ARR sales saw the highest growth of 23%, and Confluent managed a net ARR of 117%, indicating strong upselling.

**A Changing Data Processing Market:** The entire batch processing model could be up for grabs - customers moving at the speed of light and willing to pay for the latest technology could be a huge TAM. 

This is a paradigm shift, which Confluent has been trying to build into for a decade. 2025 might be that inflection year, with all the AI build-outs and use cases that are likely to need live processing - Confluent is the leader in that field. To be sure it's not going to throw data processing models into obsolescence, why would you spend money on data that doesn’t need to be processed in real-time, however, it could take a large chunk of that market.

**Snowflake may acquire RedPanda:** Snowflake is reportedly trying to buy streaming competitor RedPanda for about 40x sales: While it's not an obvious comparison, Red Panda is supposedly less than 10% of Confluent’s revenues but growing at 200-300%. But it's the synergy with the larger data provider that’s getting it a massive price tag - Snowflake would love to have this arrow in its quiver of data tools.

Confluent is best positioned to take advantage of the possible shift from batch processing to processing in data streaming; its founders invented Apache Kafka, the open-source model for data streaming. And while its invention is available for free - managing and maintaining it at scale needs the paid version. Over the years with the focus on Confluent Cloud, Confluent gets 90% of its $1Bn revenue from customers over $100K in annual revenue. 

Confluent has the cash, the tech chops, and the focus - sure Apache Kafka is open source and many cloud service providers like AWS and Microsoft also provide enough competition, but no one has the product breadth that Confluent does.

I would not be surprised if Confluent’s multiple expands from the current 8x sales after this earnings report.

VUAA shows a forecast about how much money I will have in X years from now if I start investing X amount of money a month. The estimation forecast is more than 50% higher than the same forecast for VUSA.

So, why will VUAA (Accumulating) will bring more money than VUSA (Distributed)? Is it because the dividends are paid instead of being reinvested? If I choose my VUSA investment to have its dividends reinvested, not paid to me, will the forecast be the same as the one for VUAA?

Would you explain the difference between VUAA, VOO, and VUSA? As far as I know, there isn't a difference, as the 3 funds track the US SP500, meaning they are essentially the same. Am I missing something? Will I regret if I invest in VUAA or VUSA instead of directly in VOO?

> Here’s how the company did compared with LSEG estimates: Earnings per share: 36 cents vs. 25 cents expected Revenue: $428 million vs. $405 million expected

> Global daily active uniques, or DAUq, rose 39% from a year earlier to an average of 101.7 million for the fourth quarter. That trailed Wall Street estimates of 103.1 million. A Google search algorithm change caused some “volatility” with user growth in fourth quarter, but the company’s search-related traffic has since recovered in the first quarter, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said in a letter to shareholders. “What happened wasn’t unusual — referrals from search fluctuate from time to time, and they primarily affect logged-out users,” Huffman wrote. 

> “Our teams have navigated numerous algorithm updates and did an excellent job adapting to these latest changes effectively.” Reddit has benefited from Google search updates and internal site improvements that have helped it gain a significant amount of new and returning users, which the social company refers to as logged-out users, over the past year and a half. Reddit has said it is working to convince logged-out users to create accounts as logged-in users, which are more lucrative for its business. Global logged-in DAUq grew 27% year over year to 46.1 million in the quarter while global logged-out DAUq rose 51% to 55.6 million, the company said.

> Despite missing on user number, the company otherwise reported a strong quarter and provided optimistic guidance. Reddit’s sales jumped 71% in the quarter from $250 million a year earlier, the fastest rate of growth for any quarter since 2022. The company said first-quarter sales will be between $360 million to $370 million, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $358 million. Net income almost quadrupled to $71 million or 36 cents a share, from $18.5 million, or breakeven on a per-share basis, a year earlier. Reddit reported adjusted earnings of $154 million in the fourth quarter, topping analysts’ expectations of $128 million.

1inyfc8,"Apple Interested In Making Humanoid Robot, Top Analyst Says","Source: Investor Business Daily reporting on Twitter post.

A top Apple (AAPL) stock analyst says the consumer electronics giant is mulling whether to make a humanoid robot.

In a post on social network X on Wednesday, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple is exploring both humanoid and nonhumanoid robots as part of its future smart-home ecosystem.

""These products are still in the early proof-of-concept (POC) stage internally,"" Kuo said. ""Given current progress and typical development cycles, Apple's robot mass production likely won't start until 2028 or later.""

""Interestingly, Apple has been unusually open about sharing some of its robotics research during the early POC stage — possibly to attract talent,"" he added.

Kuo cautioned that Apple is still very early in the product development cycle. The proof-of-concept stage is a ""testing ground"" used to determine whether core technologies and product ideas are viable before proceeding.

Apple's rumored foldable iPhone is also in the proof-of-concept stage, he said.

""However, many projects never progress beyond POC — the Apple Car is probably the most notable example of a project that got stuck at this stage,"" Kuo said.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1inyfc8/apple_interested_in_making_humanoid_robot_top/,1739386183.0

1inxsth,Apple to bring TV+ to Android phones in bid to boost subscribers,"Apple is set to bring its TV+ streaming service to Android phones for the first time, expanding beyond its usual ecosystem in an effort to grow its subscriber base. According to sources, the company plans to launch an Android app as early as Wednesday, marking a rare instance of Apple offering a core service on its rival’s platform. While Apple Music has been available on Android for years, TV+ had previously been limited to Apple devices and third-party TV platforms like Roku. The move signals Apple’s intent to compete more aggressively with Netflix and Disney+, as TV+ still lags behind major streaming services despite hits like Ted Lasso and Severance.

The expansion comes as Apple continues to refine its streaming strategy. TV+, which launched in 2019 at $4.99 per month and now costs $9.99, has never disclosed subscriber numbers, leaving its market position somewhat unclear. Alongside the new Android app, Apple will also make its MLS Season Pass available to Android users, giving soccer fans access to Major League Soccer matches. While Apple declined to comment, the move highlights its broader push to make TV+ more accessible and attract a wider audience.

Chevron will slash up to 20% of its workforce as the oil major implements a plan to cut costs by up to $3 billion by the end of 2026, the company said Wednesday.

Read the full statement from Chevron:

>*“Chevron is taking action to simplify our organizational structure, execute faster and more effectively, and position the company for stronger long-term competitiveness. This work includes optimizing the portfolio, leveraging technology to enhance productivity, and changing how and where work is performed, including the expanded use of global centers. We believe changes to the organizational structure will improve standardization, centralization, efficiency and results, unlocking new growth potential and helping Chevron drive industry-leading performance now and into the future.* 

>*We expect these actions to result in workforce reductions of 15 to 20 percent, beginning in 2025 with most complete before the end of 2026. These reductions are in line with our previous announcement of $2 to $3 billion in targeted structural cost reductions by the end of 2026, with some residual impact in 2027 and beyond. We do not take these actions lightly and will support our employees through the transition. But responsible leadership requires taking these steps to improve the long-term competitiveness of our company for our people, our shareholders and our communities.”* ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1inw9rx/chevron_will_slash_up_to_20_of_its_workforce_as/,1739381012.0

1. Model S: A full-size luxury sedan known for its high performance and long range. 


2. Model 3: A mid-size sedan designed to be more affordable while maintaining performance and range.


3. Model X: A mid-size luxury SUV featuring falcon-wing doors and seating configurations for up to seven passengers.

6. Semi: A Class 8 semi-truck designed for cargo transport, with initial deliveries starting in December 2022. 

Yes, Tesla will have RoboTaxis and it will be Revolutionary but Waymo is already here and working and so Alphabet should get a Trillion Dollar more for that:-


Market Capitalization:
Alphabet: Alphabet's market cap is around two Trillion dollar.
Tesla: Tesla's market cap is reported to be between one Trillion Dollar. 

Also, Elon Musk has been an Over-promise

Tesla has several subsidiaries that contribute to its business in electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage, and other technologies. Some key Tesla subsidiaries include:

1. SolarCity Corporation – Acquired by Tesla in 2016, SolarCity focuses on solar energy products, including solar panels, solar roofs, and energy storage solutions.


2. Tesla Energy Operations, Inc. – Handles Tesla’s solar and energy storage business, including Powerwall, Powerpack, and Megapack.


3. Tesla Motors Netherlands B.V. – A European subsidiary managing Tesla's operations in the Netherlands and other parts of Europe.

10. Tesla Ltd. (UK) – Manages Tesla’s operations in the United Kingdom.



These subsidiaries help Tesla expand its presence in EV production, energy solutions, insurance, and automation.

**Ticker:** [**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d)**,** [**QQQ**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)**,** [**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)**, UPRO and other market ETFs**

**Technicals:** Interested if we'll see another new low in the markets (breaking the market low the post-CPI report established).

**Catalyst:** CPI report of inflation gauges come in far higher than estimates, fed cuts seen less likely in first half of 2025, which resulted in a selloff for the entire market premarket. Inflation's back on the menu boys.

**Risks:** We'll likely see more volatility at the open obviously, and see more selloffs in the speculative/hype sectors, but I'm mainly focused on broader market movements and managing the PLTR short I mentioned yesterday.

**Ticker:** [**SMCI (Super Micro Computer, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Super Micro Computer missed expectations and reduced its sales outlook for FY 2025, now projecting revenue between $23.5-$25B, down from the previous estimate of $26B- $30B.

The company also announced plans to submit delayed filings to the SEC by February 25 to avoid delisting.

**Technicals:** Ultimately a miss on earnings, but the news of submitting filings to the SEC was what made the stock recover afterhours yesterday. Not too interested in this until we get a news update on the filings that will determine if this is not as shady as Hindenburg makes it out to seem.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The semis sector is somewhat stressed due to the possible tariffs on semis coming in that Trump threatened. SMCI revising downward is clearly bad, while they expect growth in 2026 due to future growth from AI infrastructure demand.

Obviously if they fail to submit a delayed filing then that would be a brutal blow for the stock.

**Risks:** Most of them are detailed in Hindenburg's report (Link here: [Hindenburg Report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/))

**Ticker:** [**RDFN (Redfin Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RDFN&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Zillow and RDFN announced a partnership making Zillow (ZG) the exclusive provider of multifamily rental listings (properties with 25+ units) on RDN and its sites.

**Technicals:** None to speak of, but partnering means their revenue is tied a little closer together, meaning they will trade together/greater correlation.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The real estate sector is increasingly focusing on user experiences through partnerships, rather than trying to expand outward- this allows them to charge a premium vs value.

This collaboration aims to provide renters with a more comprehensive search platform while expanding the reach for property marketers (ultimately an advertising play/commissions play for RDFN).

**Risks:** Probably regulatory issues, but likely won't be facing those in this admin.

**Ticker:** [**SWTX (SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SWTX&p=d)

**Catalyst:** SWTX received FDA approval for GOMEKLI (mirdametinib) for the treatment of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN). TAM is roughly $1B yearly.

**Technicals:** $55 is the level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Having ""the"" drug for treatment pretty much turns a nothing biotech stock into a somebody (which later leads to them getting acquired by a giant like MRK).

**Risks:** MRK calls deal off, which is the reason for the massive moves in the past 2 days and we see a reversal of that news.

* **Operating Margin:** \-2.2%, up from -33.9% in the same quarter last year

**Financial Outlook**

For the first quarter of 2025, Upstart expects:

* **Revenue** of approximately $200 million
   * **Revenue From Fees** of approximately $185 million
   * **Net Interest Income (Loss)** of approximately $15 million
* **Contribution Margin** of approximately 57%
* **GAAP Net Income (Loss)** of approximately ($20) million
* **Adjusted Net Income (Loss)** of approximately $16 million
* **Adjusted EBITDA** of approximately $27 million
* **Basic Weighted-Average Share Count** of approximately 95 million shares

Thoughts? Upstart is making a very strong comeback in the current economic conditions with high interest rates and lower rates would only provide tailwinds to their growth trajectory.

Basically, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said regional banks play an important role in the banking industry and any changes to capital regulations should be careful to protect that tier of banks. I think this explains why $KRE gained 1.6% yesterday.

1injw07,WARNING: Insider Sell-Off at Robinhood (HOOD) – Major Crash Incoming?,"Hey traders, I’m not involved in this stock, but this is something everyone should be aware of. There’s a pattern forming that could spell disaster for retail traders, and I wanted to flag it before it’s too late.


A Robinhood Markets (HOOD) director has been steadily dumping shares since December—right up until now, just before their earnings report on February 12.



If this earnings call is supposed to be so good, why is an insider selling for months?

They’ve reduced their ownership to less than 4% of their portfolio.  That’s not a small sale—that’s a planned exit. This isn’t a random stock sale for tax reasons—this is a full-scale liquidation of their position.


Best-case scenario the earnings call is strong, but the stock pumps and then dumps as the insiders use retail hype to exit completely.

Worst-case scenario  the earnings call misses expectations or guidance is weak, and HOOD tanks hard after-hours, blindsiding retail traders.

Either way, something doesn’t add up.

If insiders truly believed HOOD was about to rise, they’d be buying, not selling.

Retail traders are likely the last ones to know what’s actually going on.

Hedge funds and big players watch insider sales closely—if they sense a trap, they’ll start unloading before retail catches on.

I’m not saying short it. I’m not saying buy puts. I’m not even touching this stock.

But I am saying this is a massive red flag, and you should do your own research.

If you’re planning to go long on HOOD, ask yourself why you’d be buying while insiders are bailing.


Sound familiar? We’ve seen this before. Don’t be the last one holding the bag.

1inb7p0,TSLA isn't the NVIDIA of EV's anymore,"

I’m no Tesla expert, and I’m sure plenty of people know way more about the company than I do, but I wanted to throw out some thoughts and see what you all think.



Right now, TSLA is sitting around $330 a share, up 75% YOY. But honestly, I see some major red flags:



📉 Shrinking Profit Margins – Tesla’s margins have been steadily declining for years. Not a great trend.



🏴‍☠️ Musk’s PR Nightmare – Elon literally gave a “Sieg Heil” on live TV. Now, a huge chunk of the world sees him (and by extension, Tesla) as a Nazi. That’s… not exactly great for brand reputation.



🚗 Cybertruck is a Mess – Poor build quality, tons of issues, and at this point, it’s basically a meme.



🌍 New Political & Tariff Risks – Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.



⚡ Serious Competition is Catching Up – Tesla isn’t the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching—or surpassing—them in innovation.



🚦 FSD is Overhyped – Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.



🔋 Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze – Raw material costs are going up, and Trump’s tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.



🤖 Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent – Even before Musk’s latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla’s AI progress.



🔵 Losing Left-Leaning Consumers – Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.



Tesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs—they were miles ahead of everyone else. But that’s just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.



What do you guys think? Am I being too bearish, or is Tesla in for some rough times ahead?",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1inb7p0/tsla_isnt_the_nvidia_of_evs_anymore/,1739312413.0

I just read a Motley Fool post on why Tesla (TSLA) is down today.   Motley Fool is usually a good summarizer of news about what's moving a stock.  It mentions BYD's new driver assist, steel and aluminum tariffs from Trump, that Musk is working on DOGE, and that he's feuding with Sam Altman about OpenAI.  It doesn't mention retaliatory tariffs, a government action.  It doesn't mention boycotts, a consumer action.  It doesn't mention that people are tweeting that there is a Tesla boycott happening in Europe and that across a swath of countries sales are down about 47.7 percent. I can't post the tweet because I can't post an image here.  I skimmed the summary of Cramer's recent comments on how tariffs can affect the auto industry and there was nothing there on a boycott.

2011-2015 (these stocks dont exist anymore)

AZC -- owned the massive Rosemont copper mine in Arizona but always ran into regulatory issues and never drilled... eventually bought for pennies by a Canadian company that still wasn't successful in getting approval

AVNR -- small biopharma that developed Nuedexta that treats PBA -- uncontrollable laughter. My friend got me into this and I sold for a loss after one of their many negative drug events. I remember Martin Shrekli shorted this at one point. It actually had a good ending with a premium buyout from Otsuka in 2015. I just didn't have the conviction--I invested in a story I didn't 100% understand.

2016

""CBL"" I made a poorly informed private investment in an upstart sports league called Champions Basketball League (I just [wrote a blog about it in my profile if you want a quick dumb read](https://churningandburning.com/2025/02/my-dumbest-investment-champions-basketball-league.html)). Basically, it was supposed to be a summer league of ex-NBA players but Ice Cube's Big-3 ate their lunch. They never played any games.

Not sure if dumb or just didn't work out: holding TWTR for years with $30's cost basis and selling for a small loss before the Elon buyout drama played out. holding china tech mega caps for years and losing money while they became the worst shareholder environment ever.

This is where Generac comes in.

Also most of their products are US made, no concern for tariffs.

[https://www.generac.com/industrial/industry-expertise/data-centers/](https://www.generac.com/industrial/industry-expertise/data-centers/)

There is no shortage of data centers popping up, they all need back up power in case the nuclear option goes down. Also the current administration hates solar and wind.

They also have a nice piece of their business in Micro Grids, Battery Storage and personal Generators.

Any time we have a natural disaster everyone runs out to buy a generator. Things are only getting worse, look at all the earthquakes, hurricanes, wild fires.  The power grid does need to be upgraded as its currently a major vulnerability and a national security issue but every new construction home in America should have a back up generator, just add it to the cost of construction.

Also the US needs to rethink their Canada energy policy. Along the border from Washington state to Maine, Canada powers roughly 6M+ homes. If this trade war escalates this could be problem if Canadians shutoff the power in retaliation. They likely wont do it in the winter as they are too nice but its a real possibility.

1in2fl3,ELI5: what is risk to hold TSLQ for several months?,"Edit:  thanks for replies.  I think I understand better now, the concept of ""decay"" (due to volatility, rebalancing etc) and how an inverse ETF can go down even when the stock it's tracking also goes down.

New question:  let's say I'm willing to make a ""bet"" that TSLA goes down in the next 6-12mo... what is the simplest way for me to make that bet?  Do I really have to get into margin accts and short selling?  Basically I'd like to ""mirror"" TSLA for next 12mo.  Is there a simple way to do that or not really?

\---

I'm new to inverse ETFs and have a small position in TSLQ.  I do know that several 'warnings' say that these style investments are meant for intraday, but since it is an ETF I don't understand the risk of holding for weeks or months.  (apart from the obvious, if the tracking stock goes up)  So here's my question, if the hypothesis comes true (that TSLA goes down over next 6mo) what is the risk to just hold TSLQ ETF for that period?

Another way to ask, is there something else going on with the 'tracking' where over longer periods of time the ETF won't track to certain kinds of losses (eg; during after hours or something else...)?  Is it possible that TSLA goes down over a period of time but somehow TSLQ doesn't gain?

Tuttle Capital has filed to invest in “reverse-engineered alien technology” with the Tuttle Capital UFO Disclosure AI Powered exchange traded fund, which is one of eight new products the manager has registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, regulatory filings show.  
  
With the ticker UFOD, the actively managed UFO Disclosure AI Powered ETF will invest at least 80 per cent of its net assets in a basket of companies that Tuttle Capital “believes have potential exposure to advanced or ‘reverse-engineered’ alien technology, spurred by disclosures about UFOs and alleged advanced technologies”, the registration statement reads.  
  
Those companies will include aerospace groups and defence contractors that may have research and development programmes “rumoured to work with classified technology, potentially leading to groundbreaking advancements”, the filing says.  
  
Matthew Tuttle, chief executive of Tuttle Capital, said he had been interested in UFOs — unidentified flying objects — for years.  
  
While they are by definition an unknown quantity, Tuttle said he believed investing in UFOs, and the technology that they may use, could take off once his product hit the market.  
  
“I’m a trader. I look at \[UFOs\] and I say that they’re using a power source that is light years beyond anything that we have . . . If our government has this technology and it’s released, that will be a game-changer,” he said.  
  
Each ETF will be traded on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The forthcoming products do not have set launch dates or listed fees, according to the filing.  
  
The ETF will short companies that are threatened or could be made obsolete because of any “alien-level” technology that is discovered, its registration states.  
  
UFOD’s launch is not a sure thing, however, according to Tuttle. Without sufficient information sourced from government disclosures on UFOs, the product might not go to market, he said.  
  
The risky and opaque nature of alien investment is not lost on Tuttle and his firm.  
  
“Government confirmation or denial of advanced alien tech is uncertain, and rumoured breakthroughs might never materialise. This entire theme is highly speculative and subject to rumour cycles,” reads a paragraph in the registration statement on the speculative nature of the proposed ETF.  
  
The other seven products that Tuttle’s company registered will all employ artificial intelligence tools as part of their stock selection process, according to the filing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1in0zal/tuttle_capital_files_for_alien_tech_etf/,1739287238.0

**Ticker:** [**PSX (Phillips 66)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PSX&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Elliott Management has increased its stake in Phillips 66 to over $2.5 billion, advocating for operational changes to enhance shareholder value. Elliott is believed to push the company to spin off or sell midstream opportunities.

**Technicals:** We made a 6% move (just like when Elliott took a stake in BP), we may see another leg of movement during the day.

**Risks:** Spinning off a segment reduces income diversification (at the possible benefit of having a higher valuation multiple), more of a long-term investment risk than a short term one. In the short-term, expect a ton of marginal headlines that will move the stock up/down 1% depending on how they want to make changes.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The semiconductor industry is signaling increased demand and increased spending across all companies, which is bullish obviously. Despite slightly missing EPS they signaled a good enough outlook that the stock reacted positively to Earnings. LSCC makes low power FPGAs.

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, INTC, TXN

**Ticker:** [**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Following TMUS's announcement of compatibility with Starlink Beta, ASTS (a close competitor) experienced an 18% increase, with potential for further movement (both upside/downside) today, particularly around the $30 level.

**Technicals:** I'm leaning more towards pullback today, watching $30 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The satellite communications industry is rapidly evolving, with major players forming partnerships to expand global connectivity. Starlink is the biggest company out there, but ASTS moves whenever adoption news comes out, like it did previously with Verizon.

**Risks:** Competition from entities like Starlink may pressure ASTS's market share and profitability in the future, especially when SpaceX is expected to IPO (eventually). Remember that ASTS has 5 satellites and is working on \~19 more.

**Offhand Comments:** The market's reaction underscores the ""adoption trade"", kind of like how all the weed stocks moved with each other.

**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Nothing significant today, but we saw a huge spike up to $117.75 yesterday, likely from comments made during the Paris AI summit. Currently short.

**Technicals:** Interested in $115 level as an add, on the short side. Watching $120 as the level to cover on.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** PLTR has made the mother of all moves recently, gaining 50% in the past 2 weeks. Most of that was from earnings,

**Risks:** For a trade, I'm capping my risk at $120- everyone and their mother knows that PLTR is overvalued and run on hype at this point, and a move up to $100 from earnings might be tolerable but adding an extra 15% on top of that is irrational (in my opinion). Obviously there's significant retail interest in this stock, so will have to be agile and cognizant of what they're thinking as stock moves around.

**Related Tickers:** All AI related companies.

# [Stock futures slip as investors await Fed Chair Powell testimony: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/10/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures traded lower Tuesday as investors looked ahead to testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell while awaiting key inflation reports due later in the week.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped 80 points, or 0.2%. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
> The central bank leader first will address the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, followed by an appearance the next day in front of the House Financial Services Committee. Both events will start at 10 a.m. ET and will begin with prepared remarks from Powell.
*****
> Powell’s testimony comes at a volatile time in Washington with President Donald Trump favoring tariffs against U.S. trading partners and with mixed messages coming from the administration on its approach to the Fed.
*****
> Shortly after Trump took office, he said he would demand lower interest rates. However, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that the White House would not be pressuring the Fed to cut its benchmark borrowing rate and instead will be looking for the 10-year Treasury yield to fall as the administration institutes deregulation and spending cuts to control inflation.
*****
> Stocks are coming off a winning session as traders looked past new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The move led to the European Union saying it will retaliate with levies of its own if the U.S. tacks on tariffs against products from the country bloc.
*****
> “Not only is it difficult to estimate the true impact of the new tariffs already announced, but it is even more challenging to project the fallout from what additional levies might be coming in the near-term,” wrote Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO.
*****
> “The chair will undoubtedly be questioned about the implications from Trump’s initial tariffs and the potential for more,” Lyngen added. “We suspect that the most the market could ask from the chair is for clarity on whether the type of one-off price increases created by Trump’s levies thus far will translate into any response by the FOMC.”
*****
> Later this week, investors will receive fresh inflation data in the form of the latest consumer price index report due out Wednesday, while the producer price index will go out on Thursday.
