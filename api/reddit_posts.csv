1jconf8,Felons are not allowed to own stocks???,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some help here. I was recently released from prison after serving 6 years for distribution of cannabis. 

Before I went in I had a brokerage account with Wells Fargo. When I came home about a month ago I had a lot of notifications that my account needed to either be liquidated and closed or transferred to another institution immediately. 

I tried fidelity but they don’t accept felons. 
Another felon I know tried robinhood but they don’t accept felons. A friend recommended Chase because they have a policy where they hire people with adverse backgrounds, so I called Chase and spoke with two different advisors and they confirmed that, yes that is JP Morgan Chase’s policy and they confirmed that there would be no issue with me opening a brokerage account. 

So I opened an account and I even had a senior advisor in the escalations department make a three way phone call with me to the Wells Fargo advisor to confirm to Wells Fargo that the ACAT was legitimate and so Wells Fargo could lift the restrictions off my account to complete the transfer. After the phone call, it took about 2-3 days for the ACAT to go through and I had a fully functioning brokerage account. 

I began adding more legitimate funds through a bank transfer and bagan buying stocks and ETFs. I woke up this morning with an email that said I had an important account notification. I opened my account to check the notification and it said that “after further review” JP Morgan Chase has decided to discontinue services with me and have given me until May 12th to liquidate my account or transfer my positions to another institution. 

I believe that FINRA has rules about felons having brokerage accounts and it seems that every banking institution is associated with FINRA. Does anyone have ideas of what I can do? 

I considered opening a trust and making my sister the trustee and listing myself as the beneficiary. There has to be someway to be invested in the market. If not, I’ll be relegated to 2.5% CDs and my finances are screwed the rest of my life. Any advice helps, thanks!


EDIT: yes I do have a secondary money laundering charge as well for paying my home mortgage with suspected proceeds from my drug crime. I was just focusing on the “being a felon” part of this situation and not the specific individual charges. There seems to have been no problem “opening accounts,” it’s when I fund the accounts (with 100% legitimate funds with records going back 30 years when I was born) that there is a trigger to the legal departments and I get banned.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jconf8/felons_are_not_allowed_to_own_stocks/,1742140787.0
1jcsfrq,"Threat of layoff, 4 years to age 62, fearing recession. Financial advisor suggested protecting half of my portfolio in a short-term 4.5% annuity. Does this make sense for me?","I am not super savvy about investment strategies, so bear with me as I try to explain. 

I was decently on track to retire at age 62 and maintain my current lifestyle. But I have a well paying job that I needed to keep for the next four years to make it all work, and now there is a 90% chance I’ll be let go this summer. I will not find a comparable job in my field at my age, jobs are rare and there is too much ageism. 

My advisor said the worst case scenario for my $ is to have to live off what I can take without penalties if the market drops significantly (e.g., recession) - I’d have to take about 10% per year, selling low, and my plan would fail. 

Also, I am at 70% stock, so fairly exposed - have already lost 8% in the past month. 

He suggests protecting the non tax-deferred part (about half, $700k or so) of my portfolio in a short-term annuity that pays 4.5% to try to mitigate against losing too much more if there’s a recession, keeping the rest in 70% stocks or higher. 

Is this a good idea? Is 4.5% a good rate for a 3-5 year annuity (I’m not sure yet what duration)? Is it too late to avoid buying low?

1jd2x47,"Confusion with support, average cost, and equity value at Robinhood","Sorry for the length of this post, I thought this was an easy one but maybe not. I tried posting it in the Robinhood sub, but the moderators rejected it. Why, I couldn't say, though I do think it's more directly relevant there, though shouldn't be too much of a stretch for this sub. 

This is specific to crypto - BCH - but that doesn't matter as the metrics are the same for stocks and crypto.

I sold off most of my BCH holdings today, so that there was only 1 coin left. That made it, IMO, really straightforward to see that there was an error in the equity calculation.

I have 1 coin. Market value of 1 coin was \~$335. Therefore my equity position was \~$335. But the platform says it's \~$282.

So, I contacted support. Started with the crypto team. They transferred me away to the stock and equities team. They reviewed it and sent it back to the crypto team.

The last agent ended up telling me that equity amount was the real average cost. We went back-and-forth a bit debating that, then it ended with the support agent ending the chat so quickly I couldn't even respond to his last message. I type \~90 WPM with 0 - 1 errors, so I know it wasn't just a fast type job, he definitely typed out the message first, then copy/pasted it in and ended the chat. Which at the end of what turned into well over an hour, was frustrating, but not the issue. It IS why I'm here checking to make sure I'm not crazy or missing anything though.

**Am I missing something? This seems so straightforward, it's a math/calculating error, right? Or a label error, because I can sell the 1 coin right now, and receive more than the $280 equity.**

I sent each one of them a screenshot showing what I was saying. Here's the three screenshots, and the conversation starting with when the third agent picked up after reviewing the chat history.

[First screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/lulvcjo3x4pe1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d1b74bd67d8dc939eb808cedb518be3724f477c)

So, the third agent ""figures"" it out. Here's the conversation, my replies are in bold, their replies are italic. :

>*I am back and I appreciate you for waiting. As I take a look into your screenshot, you are seeing your equity as $283.13. To let you know, this is the amount you paid for the BCh you bought throughout the time your BCH is in your account. It will not show you the current value of crypto you hold base on the market value of the BCH since it is only the reference point of how much you paid for the crypto itself.*

>**That's not correct.**

>*That is why there is an average cost. Robinhood defines average cost as the cost per share of your current open position. It is used to calculate the unrealized profit and loss of your current position*

>**What I paid throughout the the time of my bch is the average cost**

>**The equity amount is how much my current holdings are worth**

>**and this one is worth \~333ish**

>**not \~280ish**

>*So if you want to look for the value of your crypto based in the current market, you will check the average cost.*

>**No.**

>*Check our* [*Help Center*](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/average-cost/#AverageCostandCostBasisarenotthesamething) *for more information about this.*

>**Average cost isn't the value. Because that value goes up or down depending on the price of the crypto.**

>**My average cost only goes up or down if I make a purchase**  
**I'm sorry, but what you're saying is completely wrong..**

>**The equity amount is the value of my holdings. Current holdings.**  
**I couldn't be more sure of anything in life.**

>**It's also only happening with BCH so far as I can tell**  
**Average cost wouldn't be the value of my holdings lol. Its the average COST, not value, not equity..**

>*I understand, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. If that is what you believe in, I would not argue with that at all. I am only relaying the information I can see in your account. As I check here, the total equity in your screenshot matches your total cost for the BCH. Please check our Help Center to know more about the average cost.*

>**ok, maybe it matches the average cost, but it shouldn't.**  
**i did check it. Did you?**

>*I did.*

>**I sent the Robinhood definition from help center:** If you’re using an earlier app version for stocks, ETFs, and options trading, Robinhood defines Average Cost as the weighted average amount paid for shares (buys). For crypto, the average cost is the total notional value of the crypto assets you’ve purchased on Robinhood, divided by the total quantity of crypto assets you’ve acquired on the platform. For crypto, the average cost is calculated by dividing the total amount spent on purchasing that specific crypto on Robinhood (including all purchases since opening your account) by the total quantity of that crypto acquired on the platform.

>**I'm not asking about average cost. I'm asking about the equity, which is the market value. And I believe it used to be labeled market value as well.**

>**I have no question about average cost. So I'm not sure how that is supposed to answer this inquiry..**

>**You sentYeah, look at any of my other crypt holdings. That equity number = the market price x my holdings. For all of them but BCH it appears**

>*You are looking for the value of your BCH based on the value of the market correct? That is the average cost. The equity you are seeing as I have mentioned seems to be the total cost of how much you bought the said crypto. But you know what, I will just reach out to our team for more information. Maybe they can enlighten us about this. Stay on the line and I will reach out to our internal team.*

>**No it's not. That's... Well I'm not even sure how you could think that or say that. It's 100% not.**

>**Thank you for reaching out to someone else**

>*We’re sorry for any inconvenience and appreciate your patience while we work to get this addressed for you. Once I get an update from them, I’ll be sure to let you know as soon as possible!*

>**ok**

>*Robinhood sentI have reached out to the team and I am waiting for their response. I will for sure let you know once I have a heads up from them.*

>**Ok thanks**

>*It appears that our team may take longer than normal to respond to your concern at the moment.*

>*Since I don't want you to wait too long in chat as I value your time. I will transfer our conversation to email and reach out to you once I have an update. Thank you for your patience and understanding.*

>*I guarantee that I will keep you informed once it is done. Thank you for choosing Robinhood. Stay safe!*",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jd2x47/confusion_with_support_average_cost_and_equity/,1742180042.0
1jcnfo5,Reputable Europe-based broker,"So, we've reached the point in the political climate where I'm actually starting to get concerned about the safety of having my money in the US, which is crazy. Specifically, I'm concerned about the US government defaulting on bonds, about the USD inflating without interest rates being appropriately raised to match, and about the administration taking steps down the road to block capital flight out of the US.

I don't want to be stuck in a position where the US economy melts down and my nest egg is trapped here and gets wiped out, so I would like to move my money abroad to a less risky environment.

Right now, my money is mostly invested through Schwab, plus a bit in a Barclays HYSA denominated in dollars. I'm looking for a Europe-based brokerage through which I can invest as I'm used to with Schwab, right now probably mostly in European government bonds but, generally, in international stock ETFs as well.

I'm not even sure which platforms, exactly, would be out of reach of the US government. [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/1bevdl4/what_are_some_trustable_brokers_in_europe_should/) about European brokers recommends IBKR, but that's actually based in Connecticut, so I assume it's no safer than Schwab or whatever? Trading 212 seems a bit like a Robinhood-type app for Europe, but it uses IBKR on its backend. That is maybe still safer than using IBKR directly, since the assets it owns through IBKR are presumably not traceable to individual accounts? I'd still probably rather be in something completely Europe-based as possible, since I don't want to take a risk on US securities or bonds for the foreseeable future.

I don't know whether I'm even thinking through the risks here correctly. Anyone have any advice?

I'm a dual US-Ireland citizen, in case that affects my eligibility for certain brokerages. Or perhaps not - maybe they tend to actually have European residency requirements. I'm continuing to live in the US for now, but fully prepared to move across the pond if shit gets dire.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jcnfo5/reputable_europebased_broker/,1742137480.0

1jcx2s7,Placing bonds in ROTH IRA,"My investing strategy has been to piece together a portfolio across my accounts that approximates the investments and allocation of a Vanguard target date fund.  Vanguard allocates 5% of the portfolio to international bonds.

My 401k has a good total US bond fund, but nothing for international bonds.  So to date I've been placing the international bonds into my ROTH to avoid taxes on the bonds.  At this point my international bond position is getting large enough that I'm questioning whether this is a good idea - putting it into a tax deferred account is tax efficient, but offset by reducing growth in a tax free account compared to holding stocks.

I've been thinking maybe I should just keep it simple and buy more US bonds in the 401k and switch to a stock fund in the ROTH.  I noticed Fidelity for example only holds 1.6% international bonds in the same target date, so I'm not sure there's much need to worry about this.

So I'm trying to decide between three options:
1) Keep 5% of the portfolio in international bonds in my ROTH
2) Keep 5% in international bonds but switch it to taxable
3) Redirect the 5% international bonds to US bonds in my 401k, changing that from bonds to stocks in the ROTH

1jcohtz,What is the best way to approach rebalancing during a downturn?,"Right now the majority of my retirement accounts (401k, IRAs) are in an 500 Index fund, and I put the same amount into my IRA/401k each month at regular intervals with the same proportion into the 500 fund and other smaller investments. **How would I approach rebalancing during a downturn like this so less of my portfolio is weighted towards the 500 fund moving forward?**

Selling a portion of my current 500 fund holdings (taxes aside since these accounts are tax-advantaged) to purchase other funds/stocks doesn't seem to make sense since that would lock in losses, but at the same time, investing less proportionally with future contributions also doesn't seem to make sense since AFAIK the aim of DCA is to buy the same amount regularly during high periods and low periods to take advantage of pricing (lower quantity when the price is high, higher quantity when the price is low), and my understanding is if you reduce what you're contributing (proportionally) into a fund/stock during a downturn, you're not getting the advantage of buying more at a lower price.

**Is there a good way to approach a rebalance during a downturn, or is it just a choice between two not great options?** I'm also not in any rush (in my mid 20s), so **would it make more sense to stay the current course and approach a rebalance when pricing hopefully recovers / is on an upswing?**

1jc60id,Heads up if you get laid off and contribute to Traditional IRA same year,"I had invested around $8,000 over the course of the first 6 months of 2024 into my company's 401k and was laid off. I was unemployed the rest of the year, and just before it ended spoke to a T Rowe Price rep about my options of retirement investing myself before 2025 began, he mentioned the Traditional IRA that would deduct the invested amount from my taxable income that year, or Roth where taxes would be taken out up front, then I could draw from untaxed in retirement.

  
I opted for Traditional IRA and put in the max of $7,000 in December 2024. Now that I'm filling out my taxes (single), that apparently was a mistake, because my IRA deduction is limited to only $200 because of the fact that I had access to a retirement plan at work the same year (even though I didn't contribute to the personal IRA until after I was laid off), and my MAGI range fell between their threshold of $77,000-$87,000 for the year. I would have been much better off contributing to the Roth IRA and just having taxes taken out now, since most of my traditional IRA contribution ended up taxed anyway and will get taxed again when I withdraw in retirement. Wish the T Rowe Price rep would have informed me of this possibility, but wanted to let anyone else know who may get laid off from a job they had a 401k at, and still want to invest in an IRA the same year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jc60id/heads_up_if_you_get_laid_off_and_contribute_to/,1742075115.0
1jctgo5,Quick question regarding markets and debt.,"In the near future my wife and I will be gaining a lump sum of about 400k. We owe 200k on our house and our mortgage is 2k a month. 

Would it be more wise to pay off the house and invest the rest of the money into mutual funds, making 2k a month payments into the mutual funds, or to just invest all 400k and keep the mortgage?

If we pay off the mortgage our only debt will be student loans (two vehicles both new and both paid off) and normal miscellaneous things. 

We are both in our forties. My wife has recently gone back to school, however I am the only one currently working. She will be done with school in the next year-and-a-half and should be making approximately 120k a year in the healthcare field when she is done.

Investing goal is to maximize return over the next 20 years, but also want enough liquidity to spontaneously retire (or do something for a smaller paycheck) on short notice. I know enough about investing only to be dangerous, which is causing significant analysis paralysis. My **investable** asset breakdown is (roughly) as follow: 

Cash: 13% (just sold a business and would like to deploy)

Robo taxable account @.25% AUM: 34%

CFP advisor taxable account @ 1% AUM: 24%

I have invested aggressively for my entire professional career. My paralysis has nothing to do with fear of investing, nor does it have to do with the current market conditions. My hesitation is selecting an option that does not optimize wealth accumulation.

Many stocks in the market are significantly overvalued—Tesla, Apple, Costco, Palantir, and much of the FMCG and pharmaceutical sectors, considering their sluggish growth. Even Nvidia could see its valuation tumble if China or AMD develop viable alternatives.

Market crashes don’t worry me; they’re necessary and often present great buying opportunities. What truly concerns me is the long-term effect of excess liquidity. Inflation is brewing beneath the surface, and we’ll see its full impact in the years ahead. Over time, the velocity of money has declined while the money supply has surged, artificially propping up asset prices. My real fear isn’t a crash—it’s that inflation-adjusted returns will shrink to irrelevance.

Bonds are effectively useless. Stocks are outrageously priced, making it difficult to generate meaningful returns. This isn’t a market for investors—it’s a market for those looking to cash out. Genuine opportunities are scarce.

If inflation accelerates, cash will erode, bonds will remain dead weight, and overpriced stocks will have no room for growth. In the end, nobody wins. After years of zero interest rates and relentless quantitative easing, my biggest concern is that when the real downturn hits, the Fed will have little ammunition left to respond.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jc0xk4/the_situation_of_the_market/,1742061352.0

- £2.4m ($3.12m) in cash

Third option is to invest it in a standard portfolio of global stocks, commodities and bonds (favoured by most financial advisors) but which will likely underperform the market in the long run, though with lower volatility.

1jc3b11,Would this violate the wash sale rule?,"Hey all. I sold a large NVDA put position at a loss last week because I bought them too short-dated at the bottom and knew that the stock would revisit its 50- and 200-day moving averages once it bounced, which it should do Monday. I would like to open new put positions on Nvidia, but my losses were quite deep on the last put position, so I don't want to trigger the wash sale rule and eliminate the deduction tied to the losses.

Does anyone know whether the wash sale rule would apply to a leveraged ""ETF"" that really is just double exposure to a specific stock, in this case Nvidia, e.g., NVDL, which is a 2x long Nvidia derivative? ETFs are supposed to be a work around to the wash sale rule, but I can't find anything definitive anywhere that states whether single-stock-specific ETFs would fall under that umbrella and be similarly excluded from the wash sale rule. 

 And yes, I know I can just comfortably buy puts on a semiconductor ETF with large NVDA exposure, but I think NVDA will greatly underperform others in the sector and would like more direct exposure.

It'll be an unprecedented trend that no one really knows how it will play out exactly, but there are a few ideas: 

* First world countries will lean heavily on immigration to sustain the workforce (we're seeing this now), until the pipeline dries up

* Programs like Social Security and Medicare will cease to exist in their current forms since there will be more people drawing from it than paying in

* The housing market will flip upside down, there will be more houses than people so entire markets will crash and probably never recover, the hardest hit being the suburbs. Cities should still be okay.

* Global GDP will tank, so stock markets may start declining or going sideways due to smaller workforce/less innovation. Deflation is a definite possibility

* AI/Robotics will probably be a huge player in some form, maybe quantum computing finally?

1jd1mhf,When is Bitcoin going to be a reserve asset like Gold?,"Bitcoin and gold are similar in that they have value because people agree they do. However, gold also surves a structural purpose in that people can park wealth in gold when other asset types are in a downturn, say, like in the 2008 crash. So gold serves as a safe haven with the promise of being able to change it back to other assets in the future. 

Bitcoins could serve the same function, but instead Bitcoins seem to track stock prices rather than be a safe haven in a market crash.

Is Bitcoins always going to be a rally asset, or will it change to behave more like gold in the future?

**EDIT**: It seems most are in agreement that Bitcoins are a joke! Anyway, this was actually meant as a serious question!

The reasoning is that if a structural benefit of Bitcoins can be determined, you can begin to speculate on what its proper total market cap should be. Right now gold is about 3% of the total, while Bitcoin is about 0.4%. But if Bitcoin becomes an essential structural asset, you might predict that its relative market cap should increase before it stabilizes.

However, if Bitcoins remain a rally yolo asset, it is hard to see its structural value. That's why I am interested in whether it might gravitate towards being a safe haven or diversifying asset instead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jd1mhf/when_is_bitcoin_going_to_be_a_reserve_asset_like/,1742175932.0

Trump will damage things. He may even cause permanent harm. But there's a different between significant permanent harm and everything going to zero.

Morgan Asset Management, the ETF offers a distinctive approach to U.S. equity exposure by utilizing proprietary research and concentrating on well-established, large-cap U.S. companies.

JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) said on Friday that its asset management division has launched the JPMorgan U.S. Research Enhanced Large Cap ETF (JUSA) on the New York Stock Exchange.

According to J.P. Morgan Asset Management, JUSA offers a distinctive approach to U.S. equity exposure by utilizing proprietary research and concentrating on well-established, large-cap U.S. companies.

The company said the fund is managed by portfolio managers Ralph Zingone and Tim Snyder, who bring extensive expertise in managing research-enhanced strategies.

It explained that JUSA is designed with a slightly lower active risk budget and a more significant number of holdings, providing broader diversification. “This makes it an attractive option for investors looking for consistent returns in their U.S. equity exposure,” the firm said.

The company has been implementing the underlying strategy since 1988, it added.

On Thursday, Morgan Stanley lowered its price target on JPMorgan to $275 from $278 while keeping an ‘Equal Weight’ rating on the shares.

According to TheFly, Morgan Stanley said the robust capital markets rebound it expected in 2025 is not playing out as anticipated. The firm is lowering its estimates for investment banking revenues due to recent market conditions, as volatility likely pushes out deal launches.

However, the brokerage noted that large-cap bank and mid-cap advisor stocks ""appear oversold against our new base case.”

Earlier this week, Bank of America, too, lowered its price target on JPMorgan to $285 from $300 while keeping a ‘Buy’ rating on the shares.

According to TheFly, the brokerage lowered price targets among its banks coverage by 6% on average, led by worsening growth and a rising cost of capital.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jbv0bk/jpmorgans_asset_management_division_launches_us/,1742044985.0

I have a pension with my current company, as well as some previous smaller ones which I plan to consolidate at some point.

But now I’m ready to open a Stocks and Shares ISA and save money on the side to grow. Currently I only have cash savings, but I can see how my pension has tripled the last 10 years, as my money is sitting in a “fund”.

Ive been researching hard the last 12 months, I never was taught financial literacy by my parents, so I’m really grateful for this sub! 

But I don’t know why, I still feel so nervous to open up a Stocks and Shares ISA on fidelity/vanguard.  I find it nerve wracking, but it just must be a financial literacy confidence thing.

Anyway, I’ve narrowed this down to 3 funds. And I just wanted to get advice on which you guys think, is the best to invest in.

I’m looking for a global fund, as I don’t just want to invest in S&P, as I don’t think Trump will be good for the American economy in the long term.  

All of these funds seemed to have tripled their performance over the last 3 years and did ok during covid.

But I just wasn’t sure which of the 3 to go for. Just wanted to get your thoughts.

I’m looking to slowly build up a nice pot of savings over the next 20-30 years.

1. Vanguard Total World Stock Index (VTWAX)
2. Fidelity Index World Fund (MSCI World Tracker)
3. HSBC FTSE All World Index

I tbh I I’m just confused which one to go for.

1jbsotp,"$HITI : NASDAQ , in-depth and detailed research","The importance of buying young, great companies is something everyone knows, but few people actually do it or really care. The truth is that in the market you earn more by investing in young, transformative and disruptive companies, which offer unique services; they also must be capable of being leaders in what they offer and they must have proven this.

Large companies take years to build, or decades, and in the meantime the stock is subject to significant fluctuations for various reasons, rates at historic highs that weigh on valuations, wars, uncertainty, etc..

The key is to let the business grow, year after year, not by focusing on the stock, but on the continuous progress of the company's business, remaining invested for years or even decades.

To quote Buffet: ""The market is a system of redistribution of wealth, it takes away from those who don't have patience to give to those who have it""

**Margins will increase in the coming years and I will cite some reasons that lead me to be sure of this:**

* Constant growth in Elite membership, now on an international basis (70% gross margin at current membership price of CAD $35/annual in Canada, 15US $ international -> double from next year ), I estimate they will exceed 100K by end of this march
* Completion of Fastlender installations and license sale (high margin Saas model) expected soon
* The continued increase in market share in Canada and the reduction of competitors will allow HITI to increase prices and therefore gross margins
* Increase in white label products / elite inventory
* Recovery in demand for CBD products starting in Q1/Q2
* More favorable regulatory conditions in Canada
* Increasing scale will allow you to exploit operational leverage and increase overall efficiency
* Purecan Gmbh acquisition will prove accretive to Hiti's gross margins

**By 2030** **Hiti will have :**

* Over 1 bln annual revenue (not include Germany, only canada and cbd)
* Gross margins 30/40%
* 100 mln in fcf+ on an annual basis at a conservative level
* over 20 million subscribers with 1 mln in Elite members ( 5% of total )
* Expansion into new markets and verticals complementary to current products
* Innovations and strategies underway that we don't know about

**High Tide inc ( $HITI ) is capturing market share every quarter, both from competitors and illicit market.**

**In three years, the company's market share grew from 4% to 11%, and it is well-positioned to reach 20% over the next 2/3 years just in Canada** (probably also in Germany in the long term, on the medical side).

High Tide inc has established itself as the leading cannabis and consumer accessories retailer in North America, from a simple store with 2 employees to the empire it is today. And we are only at the beginning of a long growth

$HITI It's not just fending off competition, it's absorbing it, solidifying market dominance, and reshaping its narrative from a high-growth, money-burning gamble into a disciplined, self-sustaining, and enduring enterprise.

High Tide inc [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) is not just a retailer. Called [$Cost](https://x.com/search?q=%24Cost&src=cashtag_click) of cannabis, [$hiti](https://x.com/search?q=%24hiti&src=cashtag_click) is a real estate empire disguised as a retailer. Here's how they built the most brilliant business model ever created and why it will dominate its industry in the coming years

**1) THE TRUTH ABOUT High Tide** : They're not a simple retail. They're at:

* Supply Chain Monster
* Data Company
* Brand Powerhouse
* Cost model implementation successfully replicated

**2) Their actual business**:

1. Buy prime locations
2. Collect and sell data
3. Control quality
4. Prevent competition

6. dominate the sector in which they operate, with a focus on international expansion in the coming years

**3) LOCATION STRATEGY EXPOSED:** [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) win by positioning their stores in locations that count. They buy corners with: High traffic, Easy access, Good visibility, Growing areas, Future potential

**4) DATA MONSTER REVELATION**: [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) track everything: -consumer preferences -Competition data -Traffic patterns -Weather impact -Local preferences -Pricing elasticity

The Result? Insights to make perfect decisions for the long term

**5) THE MOAT FRAMEWORK:** [$HITI](https://x.com/search?q=%24HITI&src=cashtag_click) has a multi-layered MOAT. It's unbeatable advantages:

Prime real estate, Scale economics, Brand recognition, Supply chain power, Data insights, Operating systems. But the real moat and pillar imo is the CEO.

**6) FUTURE-PROOFING STRATEGY:** Thing is - [$Hiti](https://x.com/search?q=%24Hiti&src=cashtag_click) does not stop there. They are constantly investing in the future. Current investments include, but not limited to: Mobile ordering, Delivery integration, Fastlendr technology, Data analytics, Sustainability, Digital experience and more

**7) COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:**

* Location monopoly
* Price power
* Scale benefits
* Brand value
* Operating system
* Data insights
* Supplier control, And guess what - it's impossible to replicate all 7.

**8) THE SECRET SAUCE:** Real estate appreciation + Franchise cash flow + Supply chain control + Brand power + Operating system + Data advantage + Location dominance = Unstoppable business

**9) Remember**: Assets > Operations Systems > Products Location > Everything Brand = Wealth Data = Power Scale = Control And most importantly: Consistency wins

1jbfy1n,Critic needed on the following strategy,"tl;dr Divest from US equities and reallocate capital into low-cost, diversified index funds in non-US markets. Currently 70% in US markets and 20% in International, 10% Bonds. Flip that to 60% International, 20% US, 10% Bonds. 

Also, this is not investment advice, please be careful!

Rationale:

US stocks currently represent about 50% of global equity market capitalization. However, when you factor in corporate debt, the full picture changes significantly. A company’s enterprise value is calculated by adding its market capitalization to its debt. For example, a company with a $200 million market cap and $70 million in debt has an enterprise value of $270 million. This adjustment implies that American companies effectively account for roughly 70% of global equity value, leaving about 30% for the rest of the world.

Given the current economic climate in the United States, major indexes like the S&P 500 and NASDAQ may not offer sufficient diversification. US stocks are trading at elevated valuations and are likely to experience stagnant returns over the next five to ten years. In contrast, international markets—particularly European stocks—are currently more attractively priced, presenting a compelling investment opportunity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jbfy1n/critic_needed_on_the_following_strategy/,1741990560.0
1jc0bhz,The Special Case for $RDDT,"Reddit is one of the premier social media apps out there with a cheap valuation (never judge a growth stock by P/E) for its growth trajectory.

Let's start with the fundamentals:

1. 2024 YE it had a 90.5% gross profit percentage, revenue grew by 62% (NVIDIA like growth??) and it became FCF positive. Next quarter revenue will be growing at 50% to ultimately end at 40% YoY based on guidance. I've been following $RDDT for quite some time and there is always a beat on revenue AND guidance versus what they expected so you can say there is a little bit of conservatism in this numbers.
2. From a balance sheet perspective it only has $26.7mm of debt. This company generated $215mm in FCF this year and is forecast to double to $520mm by next year. Capex spend is only 2% of its revenue. This companies management loves to run things efficiently and as cheaply as possible. On going concern is not an issue.
3. The company is already EPS positive and will turn EPS positive on a YoY basis by 2025 YE. If you look at it from a PEG perspective, it is trading at 0.74 for 2026. Anything below 1 is cheap. The only reason you see negative EPS is because the company has been expensing stock based compensation (US GAAP) requirement each quarter. This has ended in 2024, that is why you see major acceleration in EPS growth QoQ moving forward.
4. Share dilution is very minimal. A lot of growth companies like to pay employees in stock to attract talent, but that is not what reddit does. Diluated shares outstanding actually fell 1% QoQ. This is great for any share holder.
5. Reddit data is a gold mine. Google pays Reddit $66mm a year for data licensing. This has 85% operating margin - so you need to remember Reddits profitability isn't going away anytime soon because you are starting from a high point.
6. Insider trading has popped up this weekend after the crazy drop. That is a significant buy signal.
7. From a multiple standpoint, price to sales, revenue etc it has gotten cheaper despite the stock increasing in value. Reddit user growth has exploded over time, with 50% international base and is becoming a hit globally. Reddit's top 15 advertisers spent 50% more YoY and international ad revenue grew by 77%.

\- THIS IS IMPORTANT. If US were to go slow down, the international piece provides a buffer on revenue for the company.

8) Advertising approach is incredibly unique. Reddit offers companies the ability to have AMAs to offer product information. I've personally seen this in my time using this reddit. Each subreddit is highly specialized which makes advertising that much easier. People pay Meta and Google top dollar because they are able to use statistical AI inference to generate ad campaigns well. Reddit doesn't need that. If you sell bikes, there's a laundry list of bike subreddits you can target. This is the future as Ad targeting improves on Reddit.

Downside / Bear bases:

1. Highly dependent on Google search. Google search was the reason that Reddit fell after earnings because of the average daily user count fell. Management has said this happens often in its existence and they worked quickly to get back on top of user searches. Management was largely dismissive of this because of their experience and noted higher levels of people asking questions and typing reddit at the end into google.
2. AI Capex slows down. This will erode profitability on the company, but given how ""clean"" reddit data is, this is the least of my concerns.
3. Execution and ad platform growth. Growing is expensive, and if Reddit adopts a spend what you can to get it done it will have investors fearful. Based on their CFO's commentary this is not very likely because how they approach things and history shows.
4. User growth slows down. This is highly possible, but I do believe the international side of things will be a buffer on user growth.

Having said all of this, my PT is $250 for the company. This is an absolute long term hold.

Any dips should be bought and even though Reddit looks expensive at face value, it really isn't. It trades at 50x forward earnings with 50% YoY growth and a net profitability that will approach 30+%.

1jc0vd8,Bitter truth: Investing in the future's turbulent world,"As a U.S. citizen, it seems a given: The good ol' days are gone. We have a new world order coming and it's a scramble in the jockey for position. Chaos seems to be the norm. Trade wars, struggles for the economy both domestic and global. Long-term trends have evaporated. The prez seems addicted to chaos. It seems a transformation is in place.

However, for the first time in history, a U.S. president has bargaining power with energy. The USA is chockful of natural gas and LNG export capability creates leverage. Trump didn't create that, he inherited it out of sheer luck. It remains to be seen what he does with it.

Global tensions, the fight for natural resources and the risk of geopolitics are front and center. Many fear the prez and his handlers have an agenda guiding them that's been decades in the marking. Who knows! What matters to me is what to do with my small 7-figure nest egg. I'm 71 and that money was hard to come by. Now what.

Invest in indexes? Dividend stocks? Do you think one can get 7%? 6%? 5%? (And those are pre-tax numbers?) In light of the chaotic factors mentioned above, would you invest in the U.S. market, foreign markets or a balance? Any thoughts on what you would/will do?

I do take some risks, significant ones, yes, but I try my best to pick winners such that, at least, I do not lose! (Thankfully, I have been right most of the time.) I also take some big reward, risky shots now and then when I believe in something.

What is your take on what to do from this point forward? TIA!

P.S.  I have a nice income coming in that provides a good living. The nest egg growth is desired for legacy. Some family but mostly charity.

EDIT:  For those who say don't worry, it's the same old song, for decades people think the party's over. As for me, I \*do\* think that chaos and a new world order is in store. I \*do\* think that an energy crisis is shaping up. I \*do\* think that the planet is revolting, that we are exhausting its resources and that economies will/must suffer. I \*do\* think geopolitical risks are worst than ever. I \*do\* think that trump's rise and acceptance is indicative of a very sick nation. And that his handlers are going to cause a shakeup like this country (and world) have never seen. So, that's why I think investing as if everything stays the same is flawed. If someone disagrees, that's fine but that is my take. I can't believe the news cycle I witness every day. It is truly unbelievable.

I've done all of my trading on eTrade, but with the US economy \*ahem\* struggling, this feels like the right time to invest in ForEx.

As far as I can tell, there's no way to do this on eTrade, so I guess I need to set up an account with another brokerage. I don't have a ton of money to start with, though, so can you recommend a brokerage with low minimums and trade fees (like eTrade)?

1jawkrr,Will tariffs cause supply chain gridlock?,"This is a concern of mine but I’m not sure I’m seeing it from all sides and would welcome any input. 

My concern is that due to supply chain complexity, tariffs won’t simply raise the price on imported goods, it will create gridlock for goods that have multiple components and/or multiple back-and-forth border crossings.

Think of it like a freeway with a lot of cars, but moving pretty smoothly at 60mph. Then suddenly 20% of the cars are going 45 mph. And 5% of the cars stop altogether. This doesn’t just slow everyone down a bit, it locks up the whole freeway. 

I think the supply chains for most goods are currently like this. Most or all imported goods will face tariffs - this will cause price increases, but some suppliers may back off of selling to the US altogether. This will cause manufacturers to pivot to other alternatives, many of which will get quickly overwhelmed and cannot supply the demand. Some foreign suppliers will simply refuse to do business with the US. 

Just a few of these “stopped cars” will gridlock the entire system of international manufacturing and transportation, and I don’t think this is something the administration or the market seems to be taking into full account.

Am I being overly simplistic or pessimistic here? Is this not a valid concern?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jawkrr/will_tariffs_cause_supply_chain_gridlock/,1741929528.0
1jazlfx,$XP Ponzi scheme relealed,"Following up on the leaked report from Hindenburg Research about the possible Ponzi scheme at $XP [(source](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/xp-shares-tumble-on-rumored-hindenburg-short-report-93CH-3822991))—yesterday we were finally blessed with the official report from Grizzly Research ([source](https://grizzlyreports.com/xp-entire-profits-are-dependent-on-what-insiders-call-a-madoff-like-ponzi-scheme/)), showing that XP's entire profits come from what insiders call a Madoff-like Ponzi scheme.

Some weren’t surprised by this revelation, including myself. As a Brazilian and former XP client, I’ve been watching reports of massive client losses for months. Several YouTubers have also shared their horror stories with $XP, such as this one titled ""[I OWE 100,000 REAIS to XP Investimentos](https://youtu.be/VwL2GW382uc?feature=shared)"". The video is in Portuguese, but basically, the guy explains how an ""investment advisor"" misled him into buying a ""COE,"" which is a Brazilian financial product designed to rip off unsuspecting investors.

Another interesting fact: any random person can become an XP ""investment advisor"", since it’s not an employment contract. You just need to bring in clients with money to invest in their products. Of course, these advisors get a nice commission, regardless of whether their clients lose everything.

To top it off, today $XP announced that they will sue Grizzly Research, triggering the infamous Streisand effect with lots of news  about it.

The funniest part? XP grew into Brazil’s most respected brokerage, practically exclusive to the wealthy, and was synonymous with quality—just like Madoff, haha.

Also, up until recently, XP was partly owned by Brazil’s largest bank, Itaú, which held a 50% stake. But over the past 1-2 years, Itaú completely liquidated its position. I found it odd at the time—why would they sell out of such a ""great business""? Now it’s crystal clear why.

Anyway, I’m curious to see where this goes. I hope XP burns in the hell it never should have crawled out of.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jazlfx/xp_ponzi_scheme_relealed/,1741942879.0

1jb9uns,What’s Your Take on the Federated Hermes MDT Large Cap Growth ETF (FLCG)?,"i’ve been looking into the Federated Hermes MDT Large Cap Growth ETF (FLCG) and wanted to see if anyone here has thoughts or experience with it.

Quick summary for those not aware: FLCG was launched on July 30, 2024, and is benchmarked against the Russell 1000 Growth Index. As of February 28, 2025, it has $11.8 million in assets under management. The fund has had a -7.32% year-to-date performance as of March 12, 2025. It carries a 0.49% gross expense ratio and a 0.39% net expense ratio. The ETF is managed by MDT Advisers at Federated Hermes and follows a large-cap growth strategy, focusing on stocks expected to deliver above-average growth.

The fund is still relatively new, and while its strategy seems sound, its AUM is still low, which raises some concerns about liquidity and sustainability. Given its negative YTD performance, do you see this as just short-term volatility, or does it signal deeper concerns about the fund’s selection criteria and overall approach?

Also, with a 0.39% net expense ratio, how does this compare to other large-cap growth ETFs in terms of cost efficiency vs. performance? Would you favor FLCG over more established alternatives like VUG or QQQ?

Would love to hear your insights! Are you holding or avoiding this ETF? What do you think its long-term potential looks like?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jb9uns/whats_your_take_on_the_federated_hermes_mdt_large/,1741974364.0

1ja1cq1,"Trump: New travel barriers for Canadian tourists, the biggest source of US tourism. Expect impact on hospitality stocks - airlines, hotels, retail, restaurants, car rentals, parks, REITs","Today the Trump administration announced new visitation barriers for Canadian tourists. Any tourists staying longer than 30 days must register and provide fingerprints to authorities. How many Canadians actually vacation longer for 30 days+ in the US you may ask?

* **1 million snowbirds (Canadian tourists travelling to the US to avoid Canadian winters) reportedly contributed around $6.5b to Florida's economy alone during just a 6 month period**
* **Canadians were the largest visitors to the US comprising of \~30% of all US tourist visits in 2023.**
* Those tourists with billions in combined disposable income just had it harder to come to the US to spend their money
* While this policy in isolation may not have a material impact, combined with instigating a trade war and threats of annexation seemed to have turned off many Canadians (rightfully so) on spending a single penny in the US.
* Since Canada was the only country previously exempted from this rule, reversing this is policy is leaving many Canadians feeling further alienated by the US, especially given their economic contributions to local US economies

I'm bearish for Q2, Q3, and potentially Q4 for the following industries

* **REITs**: NNN REIT, Drop in tourism will bankrupt many small US businesses with thin margins in the restaurant industry. While you can't make investment moves on small businesses, this will lead to defaulting on their leases and commercial REITs that focus on restaurants will have high vacancy rates.
* **Hotels:** Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Air Bnb, Caesars Entertainment
* **Airlines:** American, Delta, United, Air Canada,
* **QSRs:** Darden Restaurants, Texas Roadhouse, Brinker International (food chains primarily with US locations attract tourists due to the novelty factor of not being able to go in Canada)
* **Amusement Parks**: Disney, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, United Parks & Resorts
* **Car Rentals:** Enterprise, Hertz, Avis
* **Retail**: TJX Companies, Ross, Macys, Kohls, Target (retail stores with no presence in Canada are often attract tourists who are interested in shopping at retail stores they can't back in Canada)
* **Energy**: Shell, Chevron, Exxon (lots of Canadian tourists do road trips and gas up in the US, but since these companies also operate in Canada and Canadians are just going to replace their US road triups with Canadian ones, I do not believe they will be impacted

Other factors to consider before making moves

* Can US consumer spending or tourists from other countries fill the economic void Canadian tourists will leave in the tune of billions of dollars?
* Will other countries follow suite, either as a response to the US administrations polices, or in a sign of solidary with Canadians?
* Even if positive relations are restored between US-Canada by the end of the year, will that change souring Canadian consumer sentiment to US businesses and travel?

In no way is this post a dig at Canadians for deciding to stop visiting. I am also Canadian. This post is a purely from a finance/stock perspective on which industries will get negatively impacted by this administrations policies the most so that people here can adjust their portfolio allocations accordingly if they have exposure into said industries. Vive la Canada!

1ja9z5h,"""Past performance doesn't indicate future results"" vs ""time in the market beats timing the market""","People love to parrot ""time in the market beats timing the market"" around a lot these days to deride people who are exiting. But doesn't that go against the other truism of ""Past performance doesn't indicate future results"" ?

Here's the core problem: ""time in the market"" depends on the assumption that the market – especially the US stock market – will keep marching upward over the long haul. People are basically leaning on the idea that past performance will guarantee future results. The underlying conclusion? The market will inflate endlessly, so you might as well park your money in US equities and call it a day.

But what if that's not true? Let's be real: the US has held a pretty unprecedented position in the global hierarchy for decades, particularly since WW2. Free trade, stable governance, and a massive consumer-driven economy have made it the de facto ""safe haven"" for the world's wealth. It's been an environment that heavily favours investors, fuelled by policies and norms that protect capital and encourage entrepreneurialism. Or at least that was the game plan until roughly two months ago.

Things are shifting now, fast. The global economic order that underpinned US dominance is under siege. We're watching protectionist measures surge, geopolitical tensions heat up, and the overall stability that investors used to take for granted is definitely not a sure thing anymore. Worst case, we might even be on the cusp of watching the US morph into one of those “faux democracies” (like Russia or Turkey), where they still do elections but only pretend to be free and fair. That’s hardly an environment where you can just assume indefinite growth and bulletproof rule of law.

And that’s the problem with the old “time in the market beats timing the market.” It depends on the belief that the past is always prologue – that America will maintain its position, its strong institutions, its global leadership. But being top dog in the global economy isn’t some birthright that can’t be forfeited. It’s earned…and it can be lost. Especially if the US lurches toward a system where power is concentrated, institutions are weakened, and allies (or entire supply chains) get burned in the process.

Japan looked unstoppable in the ’80s; then it stagnated for decades. The UK was the global financial centre for hundreds of years; now it’s not. Why should the US be immune, particularly with internal political chaos and external challenges are piling up? If trust in the rule of law collapses or there's a leader who openly sidesteps democratic checks, how confident can you be in American markets as the ultimate safe haven?

None of this means the global stock market won’t rise over time – but it does mean that where those gains happen could radically shift. Maybe emerging markets become the new kings. Maybe commodities surge amid world turmoil. Maybe some emerging tech or decentralised ecosystem ends up being the safe bet we haven’t even considered yet. You can’t just close your eyes and assume “staying in” is always the best move. That’s blind faith, and we’re past the point where faith alone can carry the day.

And to be clear, I’m not trying to doomsay or, god forbid, even encourage anyone to pull out their investments. I’m just pointing out that blindly assuming the market will always recover - just because it always *has* - is a fallacy and a risk in itself. And maybe, just maybe, the people who *have* pulled their money out for the time being aren’t clueless idiots, but just people who have actually looked at the storm clouds gathering on the horizon and decided to hedge their bets. Maybe, at the very least, people could be a little less condescending to them.

If the game itself is changing, then clinging to the old rules feels like a losing proposition. The market might still “go up” in some form, but there's no guarantee that US equities will remain the biggest engine of global growth indefinitely – especially if American political stability continues to unravel. Past performance is not a promise, and this could be the moment we all finally learn it.

For the record, I'm still adding my monthly pension contributions to VUSA, but my existing piles (about £10k worth as I'm young and poor) were taken out more or less at the peak when Trump announced his original tariffs and showed he was serious about compromising America's position in the world.

1j9ygro,Remembering stock market crash of 2022,"It’s easy to forget how short the market’s memory is.

Still remember the last few months of 2022. The S&P 500 was down nearly 25%, the Nasdaq had crashed over 35%, and inflation was out of control. The Fed was hiking rates aggressively, and it felt like a deep recession was inevitable.

Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan (don't remember which) predicted the S&P 500 would go all the way to 3,000. Michael Burry suggested an even bigger collapse taking S&P500 back to 1800. Most investors were convinced this was just the beginning of more pain. Even then people talked about stagflation and going into the lost decade.

Meta, in particular, was the poster child of despair. Down 75%, from $380 to $88. People genuinely thought it would never recover. The ad market was dying. Reels weren’t making money. Zuckerberg was ""burning billions"" on the metaverse. Investors wanted him to shut it all down.

It wasn’t just Meta. Amazon reported its first unprofitable year after a long time. Google’s ad revenue shrank. Microsoft’s growth slowed. Tesla was down to $113 at its lowest. Institutions were slashing price targets left and right. Investors were selling at the lows, convinced things would only get worse.

And then... the market did what it always does. Slowly, things started improving. Companies adapted. Earnings stabilized. The panic faded. By mid-2023, inflation was cooling. The Fed hinted at pausing rate hikes.

Meta posted a solid earnings report. Then came $40 billion in stock buybacks. The stock doubled. Then doubled again. Amazon recovered. Nvidia went on a historic run. The Nasdaq had its best year in two decades in 2023. By early 2024, Meta, Nvidia, and Microsoft were hitting all-time highs to reach even higher by end of 2024. Two years of record gains.

When markets are crashing, it feels like they’ll never go up again. When they’re at all-time highs, it feels like they’ll never go down. Neither is true.

I am a long term investor and I am thinking about the next 2, 5 and 10 years. I have no problem with the volatility.

This is a question of valuation only.

I want to zoom out and focus on the realiy and not possible future scenarios because nobody can see into the future and nothing is 100% sure.

I made a lot of research to understand the stock company and all the potential, but there is one question which I couldn\*t answer myself even tough I did some research on it. This question doesn\*t seem to be discussed here at all.

The only discussion I saw was this one here, where everyone was against the OP and couldn\*t really dissolve his concerns other then ""The future is great because of ....."" (which we all already know and which the market knows) : [https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditIPO/comments/1j81q8o/time\_to\_shreddit\_or\_is\_there\_still\_a\_chance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditIPO/comments/1j81q8o/time_to_shreddit_or_is_there_still_a_chance/)

In this post he describes it well that only because a product and company and the future are great doesn\*t always automaticly mean, that the stock has to go up. I always like to look at overall trends and history. And If I look at all these other social media companies which rely mostly on just ads and have seen high user growth in the past and had a hype are going now side ways. If you just did buy and hold you did make money but these haven\*t been stocks where it just goes up in a straigth line. (can be very volatile, but with constant trend that its a winner stock) They mostly go sideways and have been staying on the same level for years now.

What I mean with winner stock, for example IBKR. They have had a lot of volatility and a lot of downfalls. (If you look back and zoom out it just doesn\*t look like this stock has fallen a lot during some periods)

For me it makes sense to invest more into Reddit if it will become a winner stock like this for example which has huge falls but the sucess is in a long term uptrend.

And yea, I know Reddit is now also making 15% of its revenue with AI deals with Google and OpenAI. This is of course nice and great, but ads will still be the main revenue stream for the next 5 years. The Ai deals are overhyped. Most Ais just keep scraping it and there is almost nothing reddit can do to limit scraping. it will still be cheaper to just scrape it then to make a deal with Reddit unless you are a giant company like Google or ClosedAi chatgpt

And yea, Onlyfans and Patreon paywall content has huge potential and will be great, but most users are still used to not pay for anything on the internet and will also not do so in the next years. Just look at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/)

By the way, the [r/Piracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/) sub has been growing massivly over the past few months. Just recently cracked the 2 Mio subscriber and now already at 2.1 Mio users.

Twitter (before Elon bought it)

Of course you could earn lots of money with Twitter, but only with good timing. For example if you would have bought in 2014 at 45 or even 50, you practicly wouldn\*t have made almost any money. It only went up in the last few years, because Elon bought it. Otherwise it would have stayed down there.

Everyone always says ""Oh, it gotta be at least as much worth as Twitter which was 40 billions"" - But this was only worth that much because of the buyout which many said was way way overpriced. As you can see on this chart Twitter was mostly not worth 40 billions. So this argument sounds good but is lacking.

Twitter has had comparable user amount to Reddit. (not exactly the same, but better then comparison with SNAP)

If I invest in something, then I don\*t want to rely on insanely good timing of buying into and when to take profits. Maybe you buy in cheap but you see the trend of the ricing prises and think ""yea, the future looks great, the product is getting better, more users ...), but you don\*t realize that the stock has become way too overvalued.

Basicly all these Social media stocks crashed after Corona was over.

SNAP

It\*s a bad comparison because there is a logical reason why they can\*t grow ad revenue as reddit can: The users mostly use it for chatting and you don\*t want to have ads in your chat, otherwise you will just switch to whatsapp or instagram or whatever kids use these days.

PINS - Pinterest is more interesting and with old Twitter the better comparison because they are way more similar then Snapchat.

PINS is now worth $21.66 B. ([https://companiesmarketcap.com/pinterest/marketcap/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/pinterest/marketcap/))

RDDTs Marcet cap is now currently $23.19 B [https://companiesmarketcap.com/reddit/marketcap/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/reddit/marketcap/)

Now RDDT is attractive because it has way more users then PINS and in all the things which already have been discussed a lot way more potential then PINS. The valuation now seems attractive in a comparison. PINS is not in a hype at all, so it should be good for comparisons.

I am not Expert with PINS. I asked several Chatbots to compare these two and what exactly went wrong with Pinterest.

It seems that since 2022 the users growh has been slowing down of the monthly active users. Sounds similar. This has been happening to Reddit recently and will always be a huge danger for shert term price also in the future because of too high growth expectations and hype.

More competition with Tiktok and Instagram for PINS.

Reddit is not directly competing as much with these platforms, so this shouldn\*t be such a huge issue for RDDT. Reddit is more based on Text and like a Forum.

Pinterest is just pictures.

The new ad formats and ad tools which have been introduced by PINS hasn't found as much acceptance by the people who do ad campagnes.

The strategy of PINS now seems to be the integration with e commerce to directly buy the product. This already has been discussed in this sub here and will also be probably done by reddit in the future. (It\*s not a priority according to the recent calls) This e commerce integration seems to take more time then expected.

""**Monetization Challenges**: Despite a substantial user base, Pinterest has struggled to effectively monetize its platform. The company's heavy reliance on advertising revenue makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in advertising spend, especially during economic downturns or shifts in marketing trends.""

""**Pinterest**: As of January 2025, Pinterest's global monthly active users (MAUs) reached 537 million, marking an 11% year-over-year increase."" - I have never know anyone who has ever used that platform, but okay.

The issue also seems to be that Pinterest hasn't been able to attract those big advertisers that constantly run ad campaigns. Reddit is starting to get more of those big names in and already has been sucessful in this (at least to my current knowledge).

Summary of PINS: Similar problem - growth can slow down - more users doesn\*t automaticly translate into more ad revenue per user - diffictulty to compete with big more advanced advertisers like META, Google, Tiktok, Insta.

If I would want to run an ad campaign I probably also would just go to google or Meta because these are know. I guess that most marketing people currently don\*t see Reddit at the same level as an option to run their ads there, because of lacking features out of the perspective of someone who is used to the great suites of Google and Meta. (I am not an expert in this) This is also a chance for Reddit to copy the same things those big guys are doing to make it easier for people to advertise. This must also work about branding.

If you look at companies or organisations, in the last year everyone and their mother has created a tiktok account and started advertising there, because of the hype. Tiktok became a name that became so important, that even as an old person you couldn\*t avoid it. Look at all these politicans posting weird tiktoks. Look at all these companies advertising there, because they hope to profit from the hype. Every institution or politican has a tiktok, insta, even X or nowadays bluesky account. Many even have Threads, but nobody has Reddit. Literally nobody. I know Reddit is a community and not a I follow this guy platform, but this is also a huge reason why not so many people advertise here compared to the big platforms.

\-Reddit has to also become a name you can\*t avoid as an advertiser. I don\*t know how we can get there. Maybe other platforms will get worse and thats why people start advertising more on Reddit for the community and the engagement, because it can be more specific.

So if we break it down to what can\*t happen for the stock to suceed long term:

\-user growth slowing down

\-expected Revenue can't be delivered because more users doesn\*t mean more revenue per user

\-competition with big ad brands (out of the perspective of an advertiser, not of the content platform itself for its users)

\-short term hypes (you buy in when its overvalued and it never ever goes back to this level again)

\-stock going sideways and staying on the same level as Pinterest

!! You had a lot of opportunity cost because you could have also invested in a stock which brings returns!!

So, I know this is not well structured and too long, but yea, thats what it is.

# Why will RDDT not become the next PINS, TWTR, SNAP or other social media company that wasn*t able to grow monetization as fast as expected and is not a just buy and hold stock until it recovers?

If someone can dissolve this only concern then I want to buy a lot (1/3 of all my money).

1jayqap,Advice what to do with investments.,"Hi all,

Looking for some ideas/advice on what to do with my investments/pension.

What would you do in my situation?

55 year old male in the UK, looking/hoping to possibly early retire in the next3/4 years.

Kids have left home, we have zero debt, house is paid off and worth about £400k, we will hopefully downsize and release £100k from that.

Got a stocks and shares ISA with Vanguard with about £80k in it, this has lost about £6k in the space of a month, I have cashed in £50k from it (left it in the account to invest in the future) which was in the S&P 500 and a worldwide stocks ETF.

I have about £265k in a private pension with Royal London, which again has lost about £20k over the last month, would you be looking to move what is in here into safer things like bonds?

Ive been on the Royal London site and its not the easiest site to navigate, my pension seems to be in 4 funds - American tilt, far east ex Japan, sustainable leaders and European, so at first glance it seems pretty well diversified.......... but when retirement is on the horizon, things are getting worrying at the moment.

Is it time to seek out a good IFA? what would you be doing in my position as it is?

Cheers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jayqap/advice_what_to_do_with_investments/,1741938959.0
1jav8sj,"Seeking Advice: JP Morgan Managed Account, JP Morgan Automated Investing, or Fidelity Automated Investing","I'm 23 years old and recently received a $200k insurance settlement from a motorcycle accident. I plan on investing 180k of it and leaving the 20k for a rainy day, I have little to no knowledge on investing and this would pretty much be all the money I have. I bank with JP Morgan and met with one of their advisors today. They offered me two options: a JP Morgan managed account with a 1.34% yearly fee that includes a dedicated advisor, or a JP Morgan robo-advised account with a 0.35%ish yearly fee that does not include a dedicated advisor. I'm also considering a Fidelity robo-advised account, which has a similar fee to JP Morgan's robo option. The recommended portfolio is split with 50% in Fidelity 500 Index Fund, 20% in Fidelity International Index Fund, and the remaining 30% across sector ETFs like tech, healthcare, consumer staples, energy, and industrials. Does this seem like a smart strategy, or would sticking to the S&P 500 be better? What would you recommend? Is the managed account worth the extra fee for someone in my situation? Any advice would be appreciated thank you greatly ",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jav8sj/seeking_advice_jp_morgan_managed_account_jp/,1741924638.0
